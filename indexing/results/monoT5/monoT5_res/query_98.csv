f9eae6e9-8b49-45af-9865-44d496f0e5e5,"» » Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by either absolute or relative insulin deficiency resulting in persistent hyperglycemia. Estimates of diabetes concurrent with pregnancy vary widely (from 5-14%), depending upon the population in question. Most with diabetes during pregnancy have gestational diabetes (GDM), a condition that arises for the first time during pregnancy and typically resolves after delivery. However, 10-15% have progestational DM—diabetes predating conception. The pathophysiology of DM complicating pregnancy is heterogeneous. There are two major classifications for preexisting diabetes complicating pregnancy: type 1 diabetes formerly called insulin-dependent or juvenile onset diabetes and type 2 diabetes formerly referred to as noninsulin dependent disease or adult onset diabetes. The former is primarily an absolute insulin deficiency while the latter is characterized by a more prominent insulin resistant state. With the obesity epidemic combined with delayed childbearing in the United States, type 2 diabetes is by far more common than type 1 during pregnancy. Some common risk factors for type 2 diabetes during pregnancy include: increasing age, obesity, strong family history of type 2 diabetes, and nonwhite ethnic status—particularly Asian and Native American. Pregestational DM is important to identify and manage prior to pregnancy, as significant hyperglycemia at the time of conception and the first trimester contributes to an increased risk of congenital birth defects and spontaneous abortion. Beyond the first trimester, DM contributes to an increased risk of stillbirth, abnormalities in fetal size (particularly macrosomia), shoulder dystocia and neonatal birth injury, neonatal metabolic abnormalities, and preeclampsia. Management can be challenging for both patient and provider, requiring frequent glucose monitoring, significant alterations in everyday diet, consistent insulin usage, and increased surveillance throughout pregnancy. These efforts improve glycemic control and reduce the risks of adverse perinatal outcomes. Many women are diagnosed with DM prior to becoming pregnant, often by internists or family medicine providers. This is accomplished by identifying a fasting glucose over 126 mg/dL, over 200 mg/dL (during a 2 hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test-OGTT), or an hemoglobin A over 6.5%. Many DM women have not had medical care prior to pregnancy and remain undiagnosed until a routine GDM screening during pregnancy at 24 to 28 weeks gestation. Differentiating between newly diagnosed DM and GDM can be challenging, as there are no agreed upon methods to identify women with DM. These women carry the diagnosis of GDM until postpartum screening, when diabetes is found to be persistent. In general, a diagnosis of DM may be suspected during pregnancy with: an early GDM diagnosis if GDM is screened before 24 weeks, there is persistent diabetes after delivery, and/or an elevated baseline A (especially over 6.5%). The White classification is used to estimate the severity of DM during pregnancy (Table I). Important factors include: onset of disease, duration of disease, and degree of end-organ disease and vasculopathy. In the past when suboptimal glycemic control was the rule, this system was strongly predictive of adverse pregnancy outcomes as the duration of disease was closely related to end-organ damage and poor prognoses. Today, what is more relevant than duration of disease is the presence of underlying end-organ dysfunction and vasculopathy such as: chronic hypertension, nephropathy, retinopathy, and coronary artery disease. An evaluation of maternal health at the first prenatal visit is required to understand the unique risks of each diabetic pregnancy. Given the common retinal and renal complications associated with longstanding DM, a retinal evaluation with an ophthalmologist, as well as an assessment of renal health, should be performed. A baseline EKG may be performed for women with long-standing disease or hypertension. Thyroid dysfunction is commonly associated with DM and we have found an assessment for hypothyroidism useful. An hemoglobin A is useful for counseling concerning outcomes such as birth defects and spontaneous abortion, but the value beyond the initial evaluation may not be useful unless there is concern about the veracity of glucose data being given by the patient. A baseline maternal assessment is outlined in Table II. Serum creatinine, 24-hour urine protein, and creatinine clearance B1. Glucose management. The management of diabetes revolves around strict glycemic control. Self–blood glucose monitoring along with intensive insulin therapy are standard care. Self-monitoring should be conducted before breakfast and 1 or 2 hours after breakfast, lunch, and dinner (postprandials) and occasionally at 2 to 4 a.m. to assess for nocturnal hypoglycemia. The use of postprandial levels, rather than preprandial levels, to guide therapy reduces the risk for macrosomia, neonatal hypoglycemia, and cesarean delivery for labor dystocia. Additional premeal values throughout the day may be added for more challenging patients. Most women with pregestational diabetes are followed with outpatient visits at frequent intervals every 2 to 4 weeks. Email and fax communication allow for weekly communication of blood glucose levels and feedback regarding insulin dosing changes to be made without an outpatient office visit. Patients are instructed to call if either periods of recurrent hypoglycemia or sustained hyperglycemia (>200 mg/dL) without response to extra insulin dosing occur. In women in whom diabetes is not well controlled despite outpatient efforts to improve glycemic status, hospitalization is advised. Hospitalization may also be necessary for women who do not have the skills to make necessary adjustments in early pregnancy to rapidly achieve euglycemia. Target blood glucose levels for pregnancy are found in Table III. B2. Nutrition management is essential for achieving euglycemia. Dietary composition should be 40% to 50% complex carbohydrates, 20% protein, and 30% to 40% fat, with less than 10% saturated fats. Caloric intake is based upon prepregnancy weight. Underweight women should expect to consume 30 to 35 kcal/kg/day while overweight women may require fewer. Women with a BMI greater than 30 may be managed with dietary intake as low as 15 kcal/kg/day of actual weight. Caloric distribution is recommended as follows: Breakfast 10% to 20%, lunch 20% to 30%, dinner 30% to 40%, and snacks up to 30% of total calories. If ketonuria develops, caloric intake may need to be increased. Semisynthetic insulins and newer insulin analogues are preferred for use during pregnancy. Insulin lispro or insulin aspart have replaced regular insulin as short-acting insulins, as they have a more rapid onset of action and shorter duration with less associated hypoglycemia. Long-acting insulin analogues (glargine and detemir) may more accurately mimic basal insulin compared to neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin; however, the flat profile of glargine may be undesirable in pregnancy when variations in basal insulin needs are likely to occur. For this reason, it is often necessary to switch women receiving glargine to twice daily NPH insulin (morning and bedtime). A recent RCT comparing detemir to NPH insulin during pregnancy demonstrated comparable efficacy and detemir is now classified as a category B medication. Although NPH is an established staple, we commonly continue glargine or detemir for women who are taking these and are euglycemic at the onset of pregnency. Insulin is administered in two to three injections. A three injection regimen is often used with the patient taking a combination of intermediate-acting (NPH) and short-acting insulin before breakfast followed by short-acting with dinner and bedtime NPH. Some women also require short-acting insulin to cover lunch, as well as snacks. The average daily insulin requirement for pregnant women with type 1 diabetes is 0.7 units/kg during the first trimester and increases to 1.1 units/kg by delivery. Intermediate insulin generally constitutes 50% to 66% of the total daily insulin dose, whereas short-acting insulin comprises approximately 33% to 50% of the daily requirement. Because hypoglycemic episodes may result in significant untoward side effects, we use the weight based insulin requirements as a guideline rather than a rule. We follow glucose measurements for 1 week prior to initiation of insulin, identifying which portion of the day is associated with consistent hyperglycemic episodes. Insulins are begun at half the calculated weight-based dose and targeted to cover periods of hyperglycemia. Insulins are increased rapidly to obtain euglycemia. Frequent evaluation of glucose values is essential once insulin is begun due to the progressive physiologic insulin resistance during pregnancy. Weekly increases in the insulin regimen is common. It is important to communicate to DM women that insulin requirements at the end of pregnancy are expected to be far higher than at the beginning. Characteristics of insulins are noted in Table IV. Randomized trials have not demonstrated a superiority of pump therapy when compared to multiple injection regimens. For women receiving continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSII) or “pump” therapy, rapid acting insulin is stored in the pump syringe. Infusion occurs at a basal rate, which is varied according to the time of day (frequently lower overnight) and preprandial boluses are given with meals and snacks. Half of total daily insulin is usually given as the basal rate and the remainder as premeal boluses infused before each meal. Boluses are given as a carbohydrate ratio. For example, with a carbohydrate ratio of 1:8, one unit of insulin may be given for every 8 g of carbohydrates ingested. Some women may also use a glucose sensor in addition to the pump. These sensors are equipped with alarms for impending high and low glucose values, and we have found they can be useful for reducing dangerous symptomatic low glucose values in women who have frequent and unpredictable hypoglycemic episodes. Oral agents may be used for the management of type 2 diabetes, although the ADA recommends insulin as first line therapy during pregnancy. ACOG recommends individualization of therapy with the understanding that unlike insulin, oral agents do cross the placenta and long-term safety data are unavailable. In practice, women with type 2 diabetes who are well controlled on metformin are often continued on this therapy after appropriate counseling. This agent does not appear to be teratogenic. Long-term studies on exposed offspring are not yet available but are in progress. 36-38 weeks, commonly offered on a monthly basis in the third trimester Congenital birth defects are a common complication for women with suboptimal glucose management during the time of conception and the early first trimester. As such, we offer a detailed anatomic survey (18 to 20 weeks) and fetal echocardiogram (20 to 22 weeks) to identify concerns before delivery. Maternal hyperglycemia may result in fetal hyperinsulinemia, which may increase the risk for fetal hypoxemia. For this reason, algorithms for care for diabetic pregnancy include a program of fetal surveillance during the third trimester. Improved maternal glycemia has reduced stillbirth risk in pregnancies complicated by diabetes such that antepartum fetal testing is employed primarily to reassure the obstetrician and avoid unnecessary premature delivery. Most tests of fetal well-being have few false-negatives. In practice, we have all pregestational diabetic women perform daily assessment of fetal activity during the third trimester. Non–stress testing (NST) is a primary method of fetal surveillance, which is followed by a biophysical profile (BPP) or contraction stress test (CST) if there is a concern. We prefer that NSTs be done twice weekly after the patient reaches 32 weeks. In women with vascular disease or suboptimal control, testing is often initiated earlier because of the increased fetal risk. The results of fetal surveillance testing and clinical features should be factored in before intervening for suspected fetal compromise, especially in preterm gestation. In general, delivery should be delayed until fetal maturation has taken place, provided that diabetes is well controlled and antepartum fetal surveillance remains reassuring. In women who are well controlled without vasculopathy, delivery is not advised until 39 weeks gestation. Before undertaking delivery prior to 39 weeks gestation, depending on individual clinical circumstances, an amniocentesis may be performed to assess fetal lung maturity. Tests of fetal lung maturity appear to have the same predictive value in diabetic pregnancies as in the normal population. In practice, however, amniocentesis for lung maturity has become less common in the management of diabetic pregnancy as those cases at significant maternal-fetal risk (e.g., women with vascular disease) are often delivered at 37 to 39 weeks without such testing. Fetal growth assessment. Ultrasound, despite its inherent limitations for estimating fetal size, is employed during the third trimester to assess fetal growth. The detection of fetal macrosomia, an important measurable risk factor for shoulder dystocia, may aid in planning the timing and mode of delivery. In practice, an ultrasound assessment of fetal size is recommended within four weeks of delivery. Choosing the route of delivery for the diabetic woman is controversial. Cesarean delivery rates as high as 50% are common in series reported in the literature. Notwithstanding the accuracy limitations of ultrasound estimation of fetal size, cesarean delivery has been employed to reduce the risk of traumatic delivery (brachial plexus injury) associated with shoulder dystocia. The risk for shoulder dystocia with a fetal weight exceeding 4000 g in a diabetic pregnancy is approximately 10% to 25% and over 25% when greater than 4500 g. At present the ACOG recommends consideration of cesarean section at an estimated weight at or exceeding 4500 g. Our approach is to consider cesarean delivery with an estimated fetal weight (EFW) between 4000 to 4500 g after evaluating obstetric history and clinical pelvimetry. When a large fetus is suspected, operative vaginal delivery is best avoided, particularly with a prolonged second stage due to its association with shoulder dystocia. Control of maternal glucose levels during labor and delivery is important to reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycemia. Target glucose control at 100 mg/dL (between 70 to 140 mg/dL) is recommended to reduce this risk. Insulin should be given intravenously as boluses or by continuous insulin drip once maternal glucose levels exceed 140 mg/dL or earlier. During active labor, women with type 1 diabetes require a basal infusion of insulin; as labor progresses, the insulin requirement may be little to none and glucose infusion can be necessary to maintain glucose levels in the 70 to 90 mg/dL range. This mimics the glucose requirement of strenuous exercise. Frequent capillary glucose testing (every 1 to 2 hours) is necessary during labor. When glucose measurements fall below 70 mg/dL, 5% dextrose at 100 to 150 cc/hr may be initiated to prevent hypoglycemia. When cesarean delivery is to be performed, we prefer an early morning start so as to best regulate maternal glycemia after an overnight fast. NPH insulin in the evening is given at a full dose. If surgery must be delayed, we administer one third to one half of the intermediate acting dose of insulin in the morning. For women using a pump, we will maintain their basal rates and frequently assess glycemia while waiting to begin the cesarean delivery. Following delivery, insulin requirements are significantly lower than pregnancy needs. We relax the objective of tight control for 24 to 48 hours. Women who deliver vaginally are switched to one third to one half of their end pregnancy insulin dosing. If the data are available and the patient was well controlled at the beginning of pregnancy, the insulin regimen at that time may be restarted. Some women with type 2 diabetes will not require insulin postpartum. Frequent glucose determinations are used to guide therapy. All diabetic women are encouraged to breastfeed. The insulin dosing may be somewhat lower in lactating women. Metformin appears to be compatible with breastfeeding. The serious side effects of the combined estrogen/progesterone pill, including thromboembolic disease and myocardial infarction, have been reported by some to be increased in diabetic women using them. We restrict the use of estrogen containing oral contraceptive pills to diabetic women without vascular disease or additional risk factors, such as strong family history of myocardial infarction, stroke, or in those who use tobacco. For long-term contraception, long-acting progestins and intrauterine devices seem to be safe and compatible with diabetes. Diabetic pregnancy is a high risk state with a variety of fetal and maternal complications that are considered. Increased risks of preterm birth, fetal macrosomia, congenital birth defects and spontaneous abortion, as well as stillbirth are all important concerns (reviewed in Prognosis). Many of these can be reduced with close attention to reducing the frequency of hyperglycemia. DKA may occur more frequently during pregnancy and there should be attention to its development, particularly when offering corticosteroids for early delivery concern. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can occur in newly diagnosed diabetics and pregnancy may reduce the threshold to DKA. DKA may develop in pregnant women with blood glucoses as low as 200 mg/dL. Malaise, headache, nausea, and vomiting are common complaints. A pregnant woman with persistent hyperglycemia and nausea and/or vomiting over 12 hours should be evaluated for potential DKA. Dehydration accompanies DKA and therapy hinges on both correction of fluid and metabolic abnormalities (see Table VI). Once DKA is stabilized, the patient should be transported to a tertiary care facility. Fluid resuscitation and insulin infusion should be maintained, even in the face of normoglycemia until serum bicarbonate levels return to normal, indicating that acidosis has cleared. Intravenous fluids: isotonic sodium chloride; total replacement 4-6 L in first 12 hr. Insert intravenous catheters. Maintain hourly flow sheet for fluids and electrolytes, potassium, insulin, and laboratory results. Administer normal saline (0.9% NaCl) at 1 to 2 L/hr for first hour. Infuse normal saline at 250-500 mL/hr depending on hydration state × 8 hr. If serum sodium is elevated, use half-normal saline (0.45% NaCl). When plasma or serum glucose reaches 200 mg/dL, change to 5% dextrose with 0.45% NaCl at 150-250 mL/hr. Potassium: establish adequate renal function (urine output approximately 50 mL/hr). If serum potassium is <3.3 mEq/L, hold insulin and give 20-30 mEq K /hr until K >3.3 mEq/L. If serum K is >3.3 mEq/L, but <5.3 mEq/L, give 20-30 mEq/L K in each liter of intravenous fluid to keep serum K between 4 and 5 mEq/L. If serum K is >5.3 mEq/L, do not give K , but check serum K every 2 hr. Consider loading dose: 0.1-0.2 U/kg intravenous bolus depending on plasma glucose If plasma or serum glucose does not fall by 50-70 mg/dL in first hour, double insulin infusion every hour until a steady glucose decline is achieved. When plasma or serum glucose reaches 200 mg/dL, reduce infusion to 0.05-0.1 U/kg/hr. Keep plasma or serum glucose between 100 and 150 mg/dL, until resolution of diabetic ketoacidosis. pH <6.9-7.0: dilute NaHCO(100 mmol) in 400 mL H O with 20 mEq KCI and infuse for 2 hr. Repeat NaHCO administration every 2 hr until pH = 7.0. Monitor serum K pH <6.9-7.0: dilute NaHCO (100 mmol) in 400 mL H O with 20 mEq KCI and infuse for 2 hr. Repeat NaHCO administration every 2 hr until pH = 7.0. Monitor serum K DKA does represent a risk for fetal compromise; however, fetal resuscitation often accompanies correction of maternal acidosis. Thus, every effort should be made to correct maternal metabolic status before intervening on behalf of a preterm fetus. Maternal hypoglycemia. In general, management of diabetes during pregnancy significantly improves outcomes with few risks. However, hypoglycemic agents, especially insulin and glyburide, may produce hypoglycemia, which may precipitate seizures and loss of consciousness. Educating the patient and the family concerning symptoms of hypoglycemia may be helpful, as well as easy interventions, such as quick carbohydrate intake in most cases and use of intramuscular glucagon in severe cases. A. Complications from the disease—pregnancy related There is an increased risk of first trimester spontaneous abortion attributed to hyperglycemia in the first trimester. The risk rises progressively with increasing hemoglobin A levels, and this risk is mitigated by good periconceptional and first trimester glycemic control. Congenital malformations are the most important cause of perinatal loss in pregnancies complicated by type 1 and 2 diabetes. There is a twofold to sixfold increase in major malformations in the offspring of these women. Most organ systems are affected and cardiac defects (transposition, double outlet right ventricle, ventricular septal defects, truncus arteriosus) as well as CNS malformations (anencephaly, holoprosencephaly) and neural tube defects (NTD) are the most commonly found. Impaired glycemic control and associated derangements in maternal metabolism appear to be the primary teratogenic factors involved in the pathogenesis of these malformations. Control of maternal glucose levels with near normalization of hemoglobin A while attempting conception can reduce the risk for malformations to a level approaching the nondiabetic population (approximately 2%). An A over 10% confers a risk as high as 20% to 25%. Targeted ultrasound examination at 18 to 22 weeks gestation, as well as fetal echocardiography, are recommended for all pregestational diabetic pregnancies in order to detect possible defects. Preterm birth (PTB) risk is elevated. Risks of preeclampsia, co-morbid medical disease, and poor glycemic control seem to all be contributors. The etiology of spontaneous PTB remains unclear. At this time, offering cervical length screening or other common interventions to reduce PTB is not routinely employed. Stillbirth in the past was a significant concern before insulin was widely available. Prior to modern antenatal surveillance techniques, intentional preterm birth was commonly the strategy of choice, as most losses occur in the late third trimester, after 36 weeks. The etiology remains unclear. Some losses occur with maternal acidemia due to DKA, while others may be a combination of fetal hyperinsulinemia and chronic hypoxia associated with suboptimal glycemic control. Macrosomia. The most common problem that diabetic women face is excessive fetal growth; and therapy for diabetes revolves around prevention. Various definitions of fetal macrosomia are used: birthweight >4000 g, birthweight >4500 g, or birthweight >90% for gestational age. Macrosomia rates are high in women with gestational and pregestational diabetes, approximately 20% to 50%, compared to 10% in nondiabetic pregnancies. Neonates of mothers with diabetes have increased fat proportions and proportionally larger shoulders and abdominal circumferences than nondiabetics. This disproportion predisposes to shoulder dystocia and birth trauma. Risk of shoulder dystocia is as high as 5% to 23.1% over 4000 to 4500g and from 20% to 50% if greater than 4500 g. Brachial plexus injury, both transient and permanent, may occur with shoulder dystocia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) suggests that a discussion about the mode of delivery be initiated when the fetal weight is estimated to be greater than 4500 g; however, some will initiate a discussion depending upon the obstetrical history when the EFW is between 4000 g and 4500 g. Neonatal metabolic alterations are frequently identified. Neonatal hypoglycemia (<35 to 40 mg/dL) occurs rapidly after delivery. Fetal hyperinsulinemia and maternal hyperglycemia at the time of delivery place the fetus at risk. It is often the consequence of hyperinsulinemia in utero and is thus more common in large for gestational age (LGA) infants. The frequency of this complication is approximately 25%. Euglycemia during labor minimizes this risk. Polycythemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and subsequent jaundice are frequent neonatal issues, possibly due to chronic hypoxia in utero. From the maternal perspective, obstetrical risks due to diabetes include preeclampsia and high rates of cesarean section. Preeclampsia is seen frequently during diabetic pregnancy, especially with baseline maternal nephropathy or chronic hypertension. In general, the incidence is approximately 15% to 20% and closer to 40% to 50% with nephropathy. In women with GDM, treatment seems to reduce the risk of preeclampsia during pregnancy. For the most part, pregnancy does not accelerate end-organ disease commonly associated with diabetes with or without pregnancy. Renal disease develops in 25% to 30% of women with preexisting diabetes with a peak incidence at 16 years after diagnosis of disease. Class F diabetes (nephropathy) complicates approximately 5% to 10% of type 1 diabetic pregnancies and is defined as either reduced creatinine clearance or proteinuria of at least 300 mg in 24 hours measured during the first 20 weeks gestation. While excretion of protein normally increases in women with underlying nephropathy as pregnancy advances, there is no evidence that pregnancy permanently affects renal function and thereby accelerates the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Nonpregnant individuals with microalbuminuria or incipient nephropathy are prescribed ACE inhibitors, which are renoprotective. However, these medications are contraindicated during pregnancy, as they may induce oligohydramnios and may be teratogenic. Proliferative retinopathy represents neovascularization or growth of new potentially fragile retinal capillaries. These vessels may cause vitreous hemorrhage and scarring with retinal detachment resulting in vision loss. Pregnancy may increase the prevalence of background retinopathy or nonproliferative changes, such as streak-blob hemorrhages or cotton wool exudates; however, these changes do not threaten vision loss. Women with diabetes planning pregnancy should receive a skilled retinal exam as proliferative retinopathy may be successfully treated prior to pregnancy with laser photocoagulation and an associated 90% success rate. Conversely, if untreated, proliferative retinopathy may progress in up to 90% of cases with pregnancy and may not be responsive to treatment. Women with proliferative retinopathy have been advised to avoid Valsalva to reduce the risk of retinal hemorrhage with delivery, however studies are lacking to address whether cesarean or operative vaginal delivery is preferred for these women. Cardiac disease. Class H diabetes refers to women with associated ischemic cardiac disease. A high index of suspicion for ischemic heart disease should be maintained in women with long-standing diabetes because anginal symptoms may be minimal and infarction may present as congestive heart failure. In our practice, women with 10 years or greater duration of diabetes, vascular disease, or hypertension undergo baseline EKG testing in early pregnancy and maternal echocardiogram when clinically indicated. 6.

8cdbae38-612d-4cc1-95e4-2c7223027de0,"» » In the United States, as in many other developed nations, the number of multiple births has risen dramatically over the past 3 decades, with a quadrupling of triplet births. The rate of triplet and higher-order multifetal gestations has increased by over 400% since 1980 with a peak of 193.5/100,000 births in 1998, followed by a slight decrease to 153.4/100,000 births in 2009 and fewer than 20% were reported as spontaneous conceptions.(Reference 1) ,The natural incidence of spontaneous triplet pregnancy conception is estimated to be approximately 1 per 6,000-8,000 births and the remainder are attributable to childbearing at older ages and availability of fertility therapies and assisted reproductive techniques (ART). (Reference 2) Triplet pregnancies have significantly higher risks than twins or singletons for most maternal and neonatal complications. Major morbidity in these pregnancies is attributable the high rate of preterm births and extreme low birth weight (ELBW). The management of these high risk pregnancies irrespective of the mode of conception is a common challenge in modern obstetrics. In developed countries there has been an exponential increase in the rate of high-order multiple pregnancies since the 1980s. These epidemiological trends are the direct result of advances in modern infertility treatments. Concurrently, there has been significant increase in pregnancies in women of advanced maternal age. The reduced fecundity of older age significantly increases the need for infertility treatment. More aggressive measures are employed to achieve pregnancy, often with the transfer of multiple embryos and aggressive ovulation induction therapies. It is reported that in women older than 40 years old there has been a 12-fold increase in triplet and higher-order multiples (Reference 3). Triplet pregnancies are diagnosed prenatally with ultrasound. The majority are diagnosed in the first trimester particularly due to the close surveillance of pregnancies conceived using fertility treatments. Other features that may prompt early sonographic examination include uterine fundus size-date discrepancy or hyperemesis gravidarum. Women known to be carrying triplets should be offered first trimester ultrasound when the crown-rump length measures from 45mm to 84mm (at approximately 11 weeks 0 days to 13 weeks 6 days) to estimate gestational age, determine chorionicity and screen for aneuploidy. Screening involves nuchal translucency (NT) thickness measurement alone, as serum analyte levels are not applicable in a triplet pregnancy. Early assignment of nomenclature to each fetus (for example, upper and lower, or left and right) should be documented clearly to ensure consistency throughout the pregnancy. As in twin pregnancies, chorionicity is assigned following visualization of the twin peak or lambda sign, the thickness of the intertwin membrane and assessment of the number of placental masses. Later in the pregnancy, fetal sex determination can aid assignment of chorionicity. Although most triplet pregnancies arise from three different oocytes, monozygotic gestations can also occur. Identification of a monochorionic triplet gestation or a monochorionic pair within a triplet gestation is essential due to the associated additional risk of this type of placentation. (See Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 3) There is an increased risk of aneuploidy in triplet pregnancy especially in the setting of multizygotic gestations. Multiple maternal serum analyte screening for neural tube defects or trisomy 21 is not available for triplet pregnancies. However, diagnostic testing can be performed. If there is concern for aneuploidy based on other factors such as family/genetic history or sonographic findings such as thickened nuchal translucency (NT), diagnostic testing is recommended. NT measurements are distributed in the same manner as a singleton pregnancy. CVS is challenging; however, this technique can provide early diagnosis to high risk patients who are planning multifetal pregnancy reduction based on karyotype results. Amniocentesis is another option for diagnostic testing. Double sampling of one fetus’ amniotic sac can be avoided by injecting indigo carmine into each sac after obtaining the specimen, which in turn colors the fluid that has already been sampled. There is a dearth of evidence regarding pregnancy loss rates following diagnostic testing in triplet pregnancies; however, logically the risk is expected to be greater than in singleton pregnancies. Nevertheless, as the risks are inversely proportional to the experience of an operator, only experienced clinicians should perform these procedures in high-order multiple gestations. The main counseling points to be addressed include the potential adverse events associated with higher order multiples, specifically preterm birth, the option of multifetal reduction and the necessity for close clinical and sonographic surveillance if the pregnancy is continued. Prolonged hospitalization may be required and there is also a high likelihood of birth by cesarean delivery. The nutritional requirements of women with triplet pregnancies are greater than for singleton gestations. Optimal pregnancy outcomes have been reported with maternal weight gain of at least 16kg by 24 weeks of gestation. Generally antenatal surveillance of a triplet pregnancy involves serial sonographic growth evaluations. If the pregnancy is further complicated by a monochorionic pair, weekly surveillance for twin to twin transfusion syndrome is advised from 15-16 weeks gestation. With the demonstration of concordant growth and normal fluid volumes, generally weekly surveillance with biophysical profiles is implemented from the third trimester onwards. A discordance of 25% between fetuses in multiple pregnancies is considered to be a clinically important indicator of intrauterine growth restriction. In the setting of discordant growth, closer surveillance from an earlier gestation is often warranted, along with consideration of inpatient care and elective preterm delivery. Due to the increased incidence of both aneuploidy and fetal malformations in triplet pregnancy, a detailed anatomical survey should be performed by experienced sonographers. Given the increased risk of congenital heart disease among monozygotic multiples and among IVF pregnancies regardless of zygosity, fetal echocardiographic assessment is also recommended. Indications for referral to a tertiary level fetal medicine centre include: Complications such as discordant fetal growth, fetal anomaly, discordant fetal death, feto-fetal transfusion syndrome. The role of cervical length assessment to aid prediction of preterm labor in asymptomatic patients continues to be evaluated; however, this modality is often practiced routinely. Increased maternal surveillance is also warranted due to the increased incidence of gestational anemia, diabetes, hypertensive disorders, intrahepatic cholestasis and acute fatty liver. Current recommendations for timing of elective delivery of triplet pregnancy is from 35 weeks 0 days, as beyond this gestation there is an increased risk of intra-uterine demise in uncomplicated triplet pregnancies. However, 75% of triplet pregnancies will deliver before 35 weeks gestation. Cesarean delivery is the commonest and most accepted mode for triplet pregnancies; however, there remains a need for large prospective studies to determine the optimal mode of delivery. There is an argument that vaginal delivery may be offered safely to a selected population of triplet pregnancies, but this is a controversial option. The incidence of hemorrhage after a triplet delivery is quoted up to 35%, therefore corrective measures should be ready and in place at the time of delivery to reduce the associated morbidity. Of note, women with triplet pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia are particularly sensitive to volume overload and the development of pulmonary edema. Preterm delivery is the most common complication, with approximately 75% of triplets born prematurely. There is a lack of prospective randomized trials to determine the benefit of bed rest, routine hospitalization, cerclage, home uterine activity monitoring (HUAM) and tocolysis. Progesterone supplementation has been shown not to reduce preterm birth in triplet gestations. There is insufficient data to demonstrate the value of sonographic cervical assessment of triplet pregnancy, although this technique may serve as an adjunct to other forms of monitoring and to the decision about when to administer antenatal corticosteroids. There is an over-representation of multiple births among low birthweight (VLBW) infants that is accentuated for triplets. The risk of delivering ELBW (less than 1500g) infants is 10 times higher than in the general population. Dichorionic and monochorionic triplet pregnancies have a five-fold greater risk of adverse perinatal outcomes than trichorionic pregnancies, attributable to greater incidences of growth discordance, feto-fetal transfusion, fetal demise and preterm delivery, both spontaneous and iatrogenic. Preeclampsia complicates 20-46% of triplet pregnancies, compared to 5% of singleton pregnancies. It is often more severe pre-eclampsia occurring earlier in the pregnancy, which in turn contributes iatrogenically to the preterm delivery rate. Primary prevention. Prevention of excess multiple births that are associated with ART has been advocated through recommendations of reducing the number of embryos that are transferred and single embryo transfer in clinically appropriate patients. There was initially a significant fall in triplet pregnancies arising from ART in 2001 attributable to refinements in ART procedures followed by a plateau since 2002. The effect of reducing embryos is being eroded by the more recent phenomenon of ‘fertility tourism,’ where patients travel abroad to have IVF treatment that may not have the same regulatory restrictions. Approaches such as ultrasound monitoring of ovulation induction, and super-ovulation-intrauterine insemination cycles with cancellation or transfer to IVF if excessive ovulation is predicted, are other preventative measures to reduce the high order multiple birth rate without significantly reducing the pregnancy rate. The significant risk of adverse outcomes for both the mother and her infants in a high order multiple pregnancy is often not appreciated by women seeking fertility treatment; therefore, improved education may reduce the patient’s desire for aggressive measures. Secondary prevention. The option of multifetal reduction is a necessary part of counseling when a triplet pregnancy occurs. The primary aim of reduction is to reduce the risk of preterm delivery and adverse outcome in the remaining pregnancy. While some argue that the morbidity gap is closing between twin and triplet pregnancies and that reduction of triplets to twins is a social rather than a medical issue, there is clear evidence of poorer outcomes in triplet pregnancies, especially when chorionicity is taken into consideration. When comparing expectant management of trichorionic triplets to those pregnancies selectively reduced to twins, there is a significantly higher pregnancy loss before 24 weeks and preterm births before 32 weeks. The majority of higher order multiple pregnancies are reduced to twins, however reduction to a singleton pregnancy is also possible, most commonly occurring in dichorionic triplet pregnancies. More recent developments of vaso-occlusive techniques such as bipolar cord occlusion and radiofrequency ablation have allowed for the possibility of reducing dichorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancies to dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies with initial favorable results; however, pregnancy outcome data is limited. Pregnancy loss rates related to the procedure are highly dependent on operator experience. In the appropriate setting the procedure related pregnancy loss rate is estimated to be between 4-6%. Chorionic villus sampling before multifetal pregnancy reduction does not increase post-procedural loss rates. Spontaneous loss of one or more triplets is common in the first trimester. Spontaneous loss of the entire pregnancy is estimated to occur in approximately 5-10% of triplet pregnancies. A 95% rate of antenatal complications is reported that includes maternal risks such as anemia, gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders and liver disorders. There is also a significantly increased risk of fetal growth discordance, growth restriction and intrauterine fetal demise. The average gestational age at delivery is 32 weeks, with 7-18% of pregnancies delivering before 29 weeks of gestation. As prematurity is the most common complication of triplet pregnancy, there are numerous sequelae, including perinatal mortality, respiratory and gastrointestinal complications. Up to 35% of triplets have birth weights below 1500 grams. This rate of ELBW is increased in triplet pregnancies when compared to both twin and singleton pregnancies, even when corrected for gestational age. Whereas contemporary perinatology and neonatology and its interventions can save the lives of ELBW and premature infants, prevention of neurological morbidity remains unsolved. There are high rates of major neurological abnormalities, subnormal (less than 70) Bayley Mental Developmental Index, and subnormal (less than 70) Psychomotor Developmental Index among extremely LBW infants. Cerebral palsy is more common in triplet pregnancies; with some reports indicating a 47-fold higher risk compared to singletons. 6.

978af5e2-4bc4-4df4-81e1-34cdb4f00dd7,"» » Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are a heterogeneous group of autoantibodies recognizing epitopes expressed by negatively charged phospholipids, proteins or a phospholipid-protein complex. The true epitope in vivo is unknown. aPL are associated with a variety of medical and obstetric problems. Medical problems include: Arterial and venous thromboses. In contrast, most thrombophilias are associated with only venous thromboembolism. Autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Typically, platelet counts are between 50,000 and 150,000/υL. Several less common medical problems, including hemolytic anemia, livedo reticularis, chorea gravidarum, transverse myelitis, pyoderma-like leg ulcers and cardiac valve disease. Catastrophic APS, a severe illness characterized by numerous microvascular thromboses in multiple organs, most commonly the kidneys, lungs and gastrointestinal tract. The most common presenting symptom is severe dyspnea and mortality rates are 50-65%. It often presents postpartum. Complications characterized by placental insufficiency. Pregnancy loss. Losses are typically fetal deaths occurring after 10 weeks gestation. They also are associated with recurrent early losses, albeit to a much weaker degree. Abnormal fetal heart rate tracings and cesarean delivery. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by clinical features and confirmatory laboratory testing. Individuals with APS and no other autoimmune disease are considered to have primary APS, whereas individuals with APS and another autoimmune disease are considered to have secondary APS. The most common disorder is SLE. One or more unexplained deaths of a morphologically normal fetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation with normal fetal morphology documented by ultrasound or by direct examination of the fetus; OR One or more premature births of a morphologically normal neonate at or before the 34th week of gestation because of eclampsia, severe preeclampsia or placental insufficiency; OR Three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous abortions before the 10th week of gestation, with maternal anatomic or hormonal abnormalities and paternal and maternal chromosomal abnormalities excluded. One or more clinical episodes of arterial, venous or small vessel thrombosis in any tissue organ; AND Thrombosis confirmed by objective, validated criteria (i.e. unequivocal findings of appropriate imaging studies or histopathology; AND For histopathologic confirmation, thrombosis should be present without significant evidence of inflammation in the vessel wall. Lupus anticoagulant present in plasma on two or more occasions at least 12 weeks apart detected according to the guidelines of the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis; OR Anticardiolipin antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype in blood, present in medium or high titer, on at least two occasions at least 12 weeks apart, measured by standardized enzyme-linked imunosorbent assay; OR Anti-β -glycoprotein-I antibody (anti-β -GP-I) of IgG and/or IgM isotype in blood, present in medium or high titer, on at least two occasions at least 12 weeks apart, measured by standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. APS may occur alone or in combination with other autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The true prevalence of APS is unknown. 1-5% of healthy individuals will have positive tests for aPL. However, most of these people will not have clinical criteria for APS. The condition is more common in women than men and can develop at any age. The only major risk factor for APS is autoimmune disease, especially SLE. The pathophysiology of thrombosis appears to be mediated at least in part by the autoantibodies themselves. Indeed, the administration of aPL results in a prolongation of the aPTT, a prothrombotic state and thrombosis in murine models. aPL activate endothelial cells, monocytes and platelets. In turn, numerous adhesion molecules and procoagulant factors are upregulated. Examples include tissue factor, thromboxane A , and glycoprotein 2b-3a. Also, aPL appear to interfere with the activity of several anticoagulant proteins such as protein S and Annexin 5. The pathophysiology of obstetric complications also is uncertain. aPL given to mice causes pregnancy loss in murine models. Since APS is associated with thrombosis, it was logical to conclude that aPL lead to thrombosis in the placenta. In turn, this causes infarction, placental insufficiency and clinical problems associated with placental insufficiency, such as pregnancy loss. This hypothesis was supported by the observation of thromboses and infarction in the placentas of women with APS. However, it has been become clear that placental findings in women with APS are non-specific and inconsistent. In addition, it appears that inflammation may be a more important pathway for obstetric complications than thrombosis in pregnancies complicated by APS. Complement activation appears to be an especially important mechanism of placental insufficiency in APS pregnancies. Diagnosis is made based on clinical and laboratory criteria for APS. It is controversial as to who should undergo testing for aPL. Most authorities would advise testing patients who meet clinical criteria for APS. These are outlined earlier in this chapter and include unexplained thrombosis, unexplained recurrent early pregnancy loss, unexplained fetal death and medically indicated preterm birth prior to 34 weeks gestation due to eclampsia, preeclampsia or placental insufficiency. There are a few other more controversial indications for aPL testing. One is patients with a false positive serologic test for syphilis. These women are often identified since syphilis serology is routinely assessed during prenatal care. Another is patients with unexplained prolonged clotting assays. Most authorities advise testing patients with unexplained transient ischemic attacks, amaurosis fugax, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, livedo reticularis and chorea gravidarum. Also, it is probably worthwhile to test women with SLE and other connective tissue diseases. It is not worthwhile to test all patients with preeclampsia or small for gestational age fetus for aPL. These conditions are extremely common and the vast majority of patients will not have APS. aPL testing should be considered in patients with recurrent pregnancies complicated by severe placental insufficiency. Numerous aPL have been described. However, the three that are best characterized and recommended for clinical use are lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-β -GP-I antibodies. Testing for aPL is still plagued by intra-laboratory variation. Ideally, testing should be done in experienced reference laboratories with interest and expertise in aPL testing. Regular international workshops are held and international standards are available to optimize quality and consistency among laboratories. LA is a funny name for an antibody and a misnomer to boot. Patients need not have lupus and they are prone to thrombosis as opposed to being anticoagulated. LA is detected in plasma using one of several phospholipid dependent clotting assays. Perhaps the most widely used is the activated partial thromboplastin time. Others include the dilute Russel viper venom time, Kaolin clotting time, and the plasma clotting time. If the LA antibody is present, it will interfere with clotting, thus prolonging the clotting time in the assay. Of course there are other reasons for prolonged clotting tests, such as clotting factor deficiencies. Accordingly, the presence of LA is confirmed by using additional assays. Such confirmatory assays include adding normal plasma (with clotting factors) to the patients plasma. If a clotting factor is causing the prolongation in clotting, the assay will normalize. If the patient has LA interfering with clotting, the assay will not normalize even after the addition of normal plasma. Fortunately, clinicians do not need to understand the assays for LA. They can simply order a “lupus anticoagulant screen” and obtain a “blue top” tube (citrated plasma) of blood. The laboratory will provide a binary answer – the patient either has or does not have LA. Anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) are assessed through a more conventional immunoassay. The assay uses purified cardiolipin as the antigen with β -GP-I as a cofactor. The assay is standardized using standard sera and results are reported in a semi-quantitative fashion. Medium-high titers of IgG or IgM antibodies are considered laboratory criteria for APS. The IgG isotype is more strongly associated with clinical features of APS than the IgM isotype. Low titers of either isotype can occur in normal individuals and are not associated with an increased risk for clinical problems linked to aPL. Positive results should be confirmed in two samples obtained 12 weeks apart. Anti-β -GP-I antibodies are assessed through a conventional immunoassay. The assay uses purified β -GP-I as the antigen. The assay is standardized using standard sera and results are reported in a semi-quantitative fashion. As with aCL, medium-high titers of IgG or IgM isotype are considered laboratory criteria for APS. The IgG isotype is more strongly associated with APS than the IgM isotype. Low titers of either isotype can occur in normal individuals and are not associated an increased risk for clinical problems linked to APS. Positive results should be confirmed in two samples obtained 12 weeks apart. Several other aPL have been described. Examples include the false positive serologic test for syphilis, antiphosphatidylserine antibodies, antiphosphatidylinositol antibodies and antiethanolamine antibodies. Although some of these may eventually prove to be clinically useful, they are not currently recommended for routine testing. It is important to be wary of laboratories that perform aPL “panel” testing. Often numerous aPL are simultaneously tested in individual patients. Typically 10 or more antibodies with three isotypes (including IgA) are tested. Usually, abnormal results are defined as the upper 5% of a normal population. In such cases, the vast majority of normal individuals have at least one positive test for aPL. However, the clinical implications of the positive test are uncertain and likely meaningless. APS is relatively uncommon. In contrast, obstetric complications are common. Accordingly, the vast majority of women experiencing obstetric complications do not have APS. Thus, obstetric complications per se should not necessarily prompt an evaluation for APS. The etiology of most obstetric complications is uncertain. However, many cases of sporadic pregnancy loss and some cases of recurrent pregnancy loss will have a clear etiology. Thus, it is important to evaluate patients with sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss for all potential etiologies before attributing their losses to APS. For example, an evaluation of patients with recurrent pregnancy loss would exclude causes such as uterine malformations and balanced parental translocations, as well as aneuploidy of the conceptus. Patients with fetal death ideally should have a perinatal autopsy with placental examination, karyotype and a test to exclude fetal-maternal hemorrhage. Women with severe preeclampsia, especially of early onset, should have renal disease, chronic hypertension and diabetes excluded. Approximately 2% of patients with unexplained arterial or venous thrombosis will have APS. Thromboses occur in about 30-55% of patients with APS. When thromboses occur, 65-70% are venous thromboses and up to 50% are pulmonary embolisms. They are more likely to occur in unusual locations than thromboses not associated with APS. Arterial thromboses are most likely to be cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Approximately 4-5% of CVAs in younger patients will be associated with aPL. Coronary occlusions and arterial thromboses in unusual locations (e.g. retinal artery) also are more common than in individuals without APS. There are numerous other conditions associated with thrombosis. The most common are heritable thrombophilias and malignancy. Catastrophic APS can be difficult to diagnose. The differential diagnosis includes disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, SLE and nephritis. Diagnosis is made by testing for aPL. Most patients have dyspnea. In addition, over half have central nervous system involvement, characterized by confusion, drowsiness, stupor, seizures and infarction of intracranial vessels. Abdominal pain due to occlusion of mesenteric vessels also is common. The goals of antepartum therapy are to reduce the risk of thrombosis and obstetric complications. Antepartum obstetric management is not evidence based. Nonetheless, antenatal fetal testing is advised by virtually all authorities, given the substantial risks for obstetric complications. Typically, sonograms are performed every 4-6 weeks gestation to assess interval growth. Non-stress testing is initiated at 32 weeks gestation. Testing may be initiated earlier with modalities such as biophysical profile and/or Doppler velocimetry in severe cases. There should be close surveillance for the development of preeclampsia. Also, there should be a low threshold for the administration of corticosteroids to enhance fetal pulmonary maturity, given the high rate of preterm birth. Iatrogenic preterm birth is not routinely advised for all women with APS. Instead, medically indicated early delivery should be reserved for the usual obstetric indications. However, these are more common in women with APS. Cesarean delivery is not required in women with APS. Cesarean should be reserved for the usual obstetric indications. In patients with prior thromboembolism and APS, full dose anticoagulant therapy is required for life, including during pregnancy. Once the patient becomes pregnant, she should discontinue wafarin therapy due to untoward fetal effects. Ideally, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be initiated at full anticoagulant doses (for example, enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice daily). Another option is unfractionated heparin administered every 8-12 hours to keep a mid-interval aPTT 1.5 X control. (The aPTT is unreliable in patients with LA; anti-Xa levels can be used to monitor therapy in such cases.) Warfarin should be discontinued as soon as there is a “late” menses and a positive pregnancy test. It is critical to stop the warfarin prior to 6 weeks gestation. Alternatively, patients may choose to stop warfarin and switch to LMWH prior to conception. It is uncertain as to whether low dose aspirin (81 mg/day in the U.S.) should be added to this regimen in an attempt to improve obstetric outcomes. In patients with obstetric APS (no prior thromboembolism), thromboprophylactic dose anticoagulant therapy is recommended. This is intended to improve obstetric outcomes. Several but not all trials have shown efficacy. Nonetheless, it is generally accepted and considered to be effective in meta-analyses. The optimal dosing regimen is uncertain and some authorities advise using slightly higher or full anticoagulant doses. However, higher doses of anticoagulant therapy have not been shown to be superior to thromboprophylactic doses. Typical dosing is 7,500 units twice daily of unfractionated heparin or 30-40 mg twice daily of enoxaparin. Doses are slightly higher than in non-pregnant individuals to account for the hypercoagulability of pregnancy. Although of uncertain efficacy, low dose aspirin is also administered. The rationale for using heparins to prevent thrombosis in patients with APS is straightforward. It is uncertain how heparins and/or aspirin improves obstetric outcomes in pregnancies with APS. Low dose aspirin is thought to increase the prostacyclin to thromboxane ratio in the placenta, improving blood flow and decreasing thrombosis. Heparins also may decrease placental thrombosis. However, they also have been shown to have important anti-inflammatory and anti-complement activity which may be even more important. Heparins also act as an indirect growth factor for trophoblast, thus enhancing placental function. In the past, high dose steroids also were used to treat patients with APS in an attempt to improve obstetric outcomes. Although efficacy was never proven in randomized trials, pregnancy outcomes were improved compared to historical controls with the use of prednisone. However, heparins are preferred as first line therapy due to untoward maternal and obstetric effects of steroids. Steroids can be used in patients who need them for other indications such as SLE. Great care must be taken if steroids and heparin are used together, since both drugs can lead to osteopenia. Several other medications have been used to treat APS. Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) has been reported to improve obstetric outcomes in patients who failed heparins. However, there was no difference in outcome in patients treated with low dose aspirin, heparin and IVIG compared to low dose aspirin and heparin alone in a small randomized trial. Given the considerable expense of IVIG, it is not recommended as first line therapy for APS. Other drugs have been proposed as treatments for APS, including hydroxychloroquine, anticytokine therapy such as agents interfering with tumor necrosis alpha, and anti-complement therapy. Such medications should be considered investigational at present. The major concern with intrapartum management is the avoidance of both thrombosis and bleeding. As stated earlier, cesarean should be reserved for the usual obstetric indications. Induction of labor or scheduled cesarean delivery is usually arranged between 39-40 weeks gestation. Patients taking thromboprophylactic doses of heparin or a LMWH such as enoxaparin can simply hold their dose for 12 hours prior to the need for neuraxial anesthesia or analgesia. They should use pneumatic compression devices during labor/cesarean and thromboprophylaxis should be restarted 6-12 hours after delivery/cesarean. If women spontaneously labor, they should hold their dose of heparin/LMWH upon initiating labor or rupture of membranes. Such patients may or may not be able to safely receive neuraxial anesthesia depending on the timing of their last dose of anticoagulant. Protamine sulfate can be used to reverse the anticoagulant effects of heparins in cases of bleeding or urgent need for cesarean. Patients taking full-dose anticoagulant doses of heparin or LMWH heparin should hold their dose for 24 hours prior to the need for neuraxial anesthesia or analgesia. They should use pneumatic compression devices during labor/cesarean and anticoagulation should be restarted 6-12 hours after delivery/cesarean. The major concern with postpartum management is the avoidance of thrombosis. Patients with prior thrombosis should be treated with full anticoagulant doses of heparin or LMWH starting 6-12 hours after delivery. In addition, warfarin (typically at a dose of 5 mg per day) is initiated the day after delivery. Heparin or LMWH can be stopped when the INR is 2.0-3.0 for two consecutive days. Patients with no prior thrombosis should be treated with thromboprophylactic doses of heparin (5,000 units twice daily) or LMWH (e.g. enoxaparin 40 mg daily) for 6 weeks after delivery to reduce the risk of thrombosis. The major complication is thromboembolism. It is difficult to ascertain a precise prospective risk for thromboembolism during pregnancy in untreated women with APS because virtually all women with a diagnosis are treated. Retrospective studies estimate the risk to be 5% during pregnancy and the postpartum period. This risk can reduced to less than 1% with appropriate anticoagulant therapy. Heparin has several potential maternal side effects, including bleeding, heparin induced thrombocytopenia, heparin induced osteopenia, local skin irritation and allergy, and interference with neuraxial anesthesia. Bleeding is especially problematic in association with cesarean delivery. The most common complication is wound hematoma in patients who are fully anticoagulated. Meticulous attention to hemostasis and the use of a subcutaneous layer to close potential dead space may be helpful. The major maternal risk is thrombosis as outlined above. All individuals with APS and a prior thrombosis should receive lifelong anticoagulation. Adding low dose aspirin to warfarin is not recommended. It is uncertain as to the optimal treatment of women with obstetric APS and no prior thrombosis when they are not pregnant. There is no question that they are at increased risk for thromboembolism but the absolute risk is low. It seems as though women with conditions such as SLE, fetal death, and/or high titer antibodies are at higher risk than those with recurrent early pregnancy loss but clear data are lacking. Currently, authorities do not recommend full anticoagulant therapy in women with APS when they are not pregnant. Some authorities recommend that patients with obstetric APS take low dose aspirin for life. It makes sense to modify risk factors such as obesity and smoking and to avoid high risk situations such as estrogen containing oral contraceptives There is a dramatic increase in the risk for adverse obstetric outcomes in untreated pregnancies with APS. Obstetric outcomes are greatly improved with medical treatment. However, even with treatment, adverse outcomes are common. Preterm birth. The risk of preterm birth in pregnancies complicated by APS is 12-35%. The rate of spontaneous preterm birth is not increased. Preterm birth is increased due to iatrogenic delivery related to preeclampsia, fetal growth restriction, and abnormal fetal testing. Placental insufficiency. There is an increased rate of placental insufficiency, abnormal fetal testing and need for cesarean delivery. Specific percentages vary greatly among studies. It is noteworthy that fetal assessment may be abnormal as early as the mid-second trimester in severe cases. Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR): Approximately one-fourth of patients with thrombosis and/or prior fetal death will have FGR despite treatment. As with preeclampsia, the risk for FGR is much lower in patients with recurrent early pregnancy loss as their only aPL associated disorder. Preeclampsia. There is an increased risk for preeclampsia in patients with APS. The rate is as a high as 35% even after treatment with heparin and aspirin in patients with either thrombosis or prior fetal death. It is lower in patients whose only feature of the syndrome is recurrent early pregnancy loss. Pregnancy loss. The rate of pregnancy loss in untreated patients with both LA and high titer IgG aCL is as high as 90%! However, the risk is lowered to 15% with treatment – a rate very similar to the baseline rate of clinically recognized pregnancy loss. Patients with APS are at increased risk of thrombosis and developing autoimmune disease when they are not pregnant. Women with primary APS are at increased risk for the subsequent development or presentation of SLE and other autoimmune diseases. The risk is highest in women with LA and high titer IgG aCL. There are no interventions shown to reduce this risk. Patients with APS and prior thrombosis are at increased risk for bleeding complications. Women on life long anticoagulation with warfarin should be followed in a clinic that carefully monitors anticoagulant levels. Obstetrician gynecologists should be alert to an increased incidence of menorrhaghia and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts in these women. APS has important implications for contraception. Women with APS should not take estrogen containing oral contraceptives if they are not fully anticoagulated. It is controversial as to whether patients with prior thrombosis on warfarin can safely take estrogen containing oral contraceptives. One could argue that the risk of pregnancy outweighs the risk of estrogen in these women. However, since effective alternative forms of contraception are available, many recommend that women with APS, even if anticoagulated, should avoid estrogen containing oral contraceptives. Most other forms of contraception are safe in women with APS. Progesterone does not increase the risk of thrombosis and need not be avoided. Some women taking warfarin have increased menstrual bleeding wih Paraguard IUDs. Mirena IUDs may be preferable in these women. 6.

Placenta previa is commonly diagnosed on routine ultrasonography before 20 weeks' gestation, but in nearly 90 percent of patients it ultimately resolves. Women who have asymptomatic previa can continue normal activities, with repeat ultrasonographic evaluation at 28 weeks. Persistent previa in the third trimester mandates pelvic rest and hospitalization if significant bleeding occurs. Placental abruption is the most common cause of serious vaginal bleeding, occurring in 1 percent of pregnancies. Management of abruption may require rapid operative delivery to prevent neonatal morbidity and mortality. Vasa previa is rare but can result in fetal exsanguination with rupture of membranes. Significant vaginal bleeding from any cause is managed with rapid assessment of maternal and fetal status, fluid resuscitation, replacement of blood products when necessary, and an appropriately timed delivery. Vaginal bleeding after midpregnancy is associated with maternal and fetal risks. Maternal morbidity may be caused by acute hemorrhage and operative delivery, and the fetus may be compromised by uteroplacental insufficiency and premature birth. Optimal management of late pregnancy bleeding depends on accurate identification of the cause and a timely intervention specific to its severity. A sterile speculum examination can be performed safely before ultrasonographic evaluation of placental localization, but a digital examination should be avoided until placenta previa is excluded by ultrasonography. Women with bleeding in late pregnancy who are Rh negative should receive Rh(D) immune globulin (Rhogam) after performance of a Kleihauer-Betke test to determine the appropriate dose. Placenta previa is a common incidental finding on second trimester ultrasonography and should be confirmed in the third trimester. Corticosteroids should be administered to women who have bleeding from placenta previa at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation. Outpatient management of placenta previa is appropriate in selected patients who do not have active bleeding and who can rapidly access a hospital with operative labor and delivery services. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis may help confirm a diagnosis of invasive placenta and identify organ involvement associated with placenta percreta. Treatment of preeclampsia with magnesium sulfate decreases the risk of placental abruption and improves maternal outcomes.

Abstract The history, a physical examination, ultrasonography for placental location, and a brief period of observation usually differentiate minor from serious causes of vaginal bleeding. Cervical dilatation during normal labor is commonly accompanied by a small amount of blood or blood-tinged mucus (bloody show), and many pregnant women experience spotting or minor bleeding after sexual intercourse or a digital vaginal examination. Cervicitis, cervical ectropion, cervical polyps, and cervical cancer are possible underlying causes. Evaluation with a sterile speculum may be performed safely before ultrasonographic evaluation of placental location; however, digital examination should not be performed unless ultrasonography excludes a placenta previa. Abstract The initial management of significant bleeding in late pregnancy is similar regardless of the etiology. Visual estimates of blood loss should be recorded but may be inaccurate or fail to account for concealed hemorrhage. Hypotension, tachycardia, and maternal symptoms of hemodynamic instability are ominous indicators, and women with these signs require immediate intravenous access, fluid resuscitation, and the availability of blood products. Baseline laboratory tests include hematocrit, platelet count, fibrinogen level, coagulation studies, blood type, and antibody screen. Women who are Rh negative should receive Rh(D) immune globulin (Rhogam); a Kleihauer-Betke test should be performed to determine the appropriate dose. Continuous fetal monitoring is recommended. Decelerations or loss of variability may resolve with adequate maternal resuscitation; however, a persistently nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing may require urgent cesarean delivery before the etiology of the hemorrhage is established. Abstract Placenta previa is a placental implantation that overlies or is within 2 cm (0.8 inches) of the internal cervical os. The placenta is described as a complete previa when it covers the os and as a marginal previa when the edge lies within 2 cm of the os. When the edge is 2 to 3.5 cm (1.4 inches) from the os, the placenta may be described as low lying . Transvaginal ultrasonography allows precise assessment of the distance between the internal os and the placental edge . Types of placenta previa: low lying, marginal, and complete.

The incidence of placenta previa increases with age, parity, tobacco use, and number of cesarean deliveries.  Additional risk factors are listed in . Risk Factors for Major Causes of Vaginal Bleeding in Late Pregnancy Unexplained elevated maternal alpha fetoprotein level Risk Factors for Major Causes of Vaginal Bleeding in Late Pregnancy Unexplained elevated maternal alpha fetoprotein level Placenta previa is a common incidental finding on second trimester ultrasonography. It is evident on approximately 4 percent of ultrasound studies performed at 20 to 24 weeks' gestation but is present at term in only 0.4 percent of pregnancies. When placenta previa is suspected on transabdominal ultrasonography, transvaginal ultrasonography should be performed. Transvaginal ultrasonography is safe and is more accurate than transabdominal ultrasonography because the placental edge and the internal os, located deep within the bony pelvis, often are obscured by acoustic shadows from the symphysis or the fetus. Visualization of relevant structures is poor on 50 percent of transabdominal ultrasonograms, and additional transvaginal ultrasonography changes the diagnosis in 26 percent of cases. The migration of the placenta away from the lower uterine segment is caused by the growth of placental trophoblasts toward the fundus, with its richer blood supply, and the development or elongation of the lower uterine segment. Symptomatic placenta previa usually manifests as vaginal bleeding in the late second or third trimester, often after sexual intercourse. The bleeding typically is painless unless labor or placental abruption occurs. This initial sentinel bleed usually is not sufficient to produce hemodynamic instability or to threaten the fetus in the absence of cervical instrumentation or cervical digital examination. Women with bleeding from placenta previa generally are admitted to the hospital for an initial assessment. Because most neonatal morbidity and mortality associated with placenta previa results from complications of prematurity, the main therapeutic strategy is to prolong pregnancy until fetal lung maturity is achieved . Tocolytic agents may be used safely to prolong gestation if vaginal bleeding occurs with preterm contractions. Corticosteroids should be administered to women who have bleeding from placenta previa at 24 to 34 weeks' estimated gestation. *— Severe bleeding, hemodynamic instability, or nonreassuring fetal heart tones without improvement after fluid resuscitation. *— Severe bleeding, hemodynamic instability, or nonreassuring fetal heart tones without improvement after fluid resuscitation. A Cochrane review found few randomized trials of interventions for placenta previa. Outpatient management is appropriate for selected patients who do not have active bleeding and who can rapidly access a hospital with operative labor and delivery services. Cervical cerclage has been proposed as a means of prolonging pregnancies complicated by placenta previa, because bleeding occurs in late pregnancy as the placenta is sheared from a lengthening lower uterine segment and dilating cervix. The Cochrane meta-analysis found that cerclage decreased the risk of premature birth before 34 weeks (relative risk = 0.45; 95% confidence interval, 0.23 to 0.87); however, it is recommended that additional studies of cerclage be performed before this clinical practice is introduced. The likelihood of a previa persisting until term increases if the previa is complete, if it is present at a later gestational age, or if there is a history of cesarean delivery . The length by which the placenta overlaps the internal os at 18 to 23 weeks is highly predictive for the persistence of placenta previa. If the overlap is less than 1.5 cm (0.6 inches) at 18 to 23 weeks, placenta previa typically resolves; if the overlap is 2.5 cm (1 inch) or greater at 20 to 23 weeks, persistence to term is likely. Women with asymptomatic previa in the second trimester can continue normal activities until follow-up ultrasonography is performed at approximately 28 weeks. Women with persistent placenta previa in the third trimester should report any bleeding and abstain from intercourse and use of tampons.

Obstet Gynecol 2002;99(5 pt 1):695. Because placenta previa may resolve close to term, it is recommended that no decision on mode of delivery be made until after ultrasonography at 36 weeks. Women whose placental edge is 2 cm or more from the internal os at term can expect to deliver vaginally unless heavy bleeding ensues. Women whose placenta is located 1 to 2 cm (0.4 to 0.8 inches) from the os may attempt vaginal delivery in a facility capable of moving rapidly to cesarean delivery if necessary. Women with a nonbleeding placenta previa may have amniocentesis at 36 to 37 weeks to document pulmonary maturity before a scheduled cesarean delivery. Management of placenta previa is summarized in . Women with a history of cesarean delivery who present with placenta previa or a placenta located at the site of the previous incision should be evaluated for potential placenta accreta with color-flow Doppler by an experienced sonographer . The risks of placenta accreta, increta, and percreta increase with the number of previous cesarean deliveries. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pelvis may help confirm the diagnosis of an invasive placenta and delineate organ involvement in women with a placenta percreta. A suspected placenta accreta necessitates preparation for possible cesarean hysterectomy, including appropriate surgical expertise and availability of blood.

Abstract Placental abruption is the separation of the placenta from the uterine wall before delivery. Abruption is the most common cause of serious vaginal bleeding, occurring in 1 percent of pregnancies. Neonatal death occurs in 10 to 30 percent of cases. Approximately 50 percent of placental abruptions occur before 36 weeks' gestation, resulting in adverse outcomes secondary to prematurity. The incidence of abruption increased between 1979 and 2001, possibly as a result of rising rates of hypertension and stimulant abuse and increased diagnosis by ultrasonography. Risk factors associated with abruption include tobacco or cocaine use, chronic hypertension, preeclampsia, thrombophilias, abdominal trauma, and abruption in a previous pregnancy. Sudden uterine decompression after rupture of membranes or delivery of a first twin may precipitate placental abruption.  Additional risk factors are listed in . Placental abruption typically manifests as vaginal bleeding, uterine tenderness or back pain, and evidence of fetal distress. Preterm labor, growth restriction, and intrauterine fetal death also may occur. The fundus often is tender to palpation, and pain occurs between contractions. Bleeding may be completely or partially concealed or may be bright, dark, or intermixed with amniotic fluid. Disseminated intravascular coagulation may result from the release of thromboplastin into the maternal circulation with placental separation. This occurs in about 10 percent of abruptions and is more common with fetal death. A chronic form of abruption may manifest as recurrent vaginal bleeding with episodic pain and contractions. Because the unpredictable nature of abruption does not allow for controlled trials, management remains empiric. A Cochrane review found no randomized controlled trials assessing interventions for placental abruption that met inclusion criteria. Initial management includes rapid stabilization of maternal cardiopulmonary status and assessment of fetal well-being. Delay can be fatal to the fetus; 30 percent of perinatal deaths in one case series occurred within two hours of admission. Definitive management should never be delayed for ultrasound confirmation because ultrasonography is not reliable in diagnosing abruption . Acute blood clots and the placenta are hyperechoic on ultranography and difficult to distinguish from one another. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Maternal stabilization requires serial evaluation of the hematocrit and coagulation studies to determine whether disseminated intravascular coagulation is present. Tocolysis generally is contraindicated except in mild abruption before 34 weeks' gestation, when it may be used to allow administration of corticosteroids. A nonreassuring fetal heart tracing necessitates rapid, usually cesarean, delivery. A decision-to-delivery interval of 20 minutes or less resulted in improved neonatal outcomes in a case-control study of severe abruption. Occasionally, abruption occurs during the second stage, and an operative vaginal delivery may be attempted. When fetal death occurs secondary to abruption, vaginal delivery should be the goal. Serial ultrasonography and antepartum surveillance in the third trimester are appropriate for women with chronic abruption because of the potential for uteroplacental insufficiency. The incidence of placental abruption may be decreased by cessation of tobacco, cocaine, or amphetamine use, and appropriate care for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. One trial demonstrated a reduction in the incidence of abruption with intrapartum treatment of preeclampsia using magnesium sulfate. Abstract Vasa previa is the velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord into the membranes in the lower uterine segment resulting in the presence of fetal vessels between the cervix and presenting part. Although it is uncommon (the incidence is 1 in 2,500 births), it is important for physicians to be familiar with vasa previa because rapid intervention is essential for fetal survival. Studies demonstrate a 33 to 100 percent rate of perinatal mortality secondary to vasa previa.  Risk factors for vasa previa include in vitro fertilization, placenta previa, and bilobed and succenturiate-lobed placentas . Vasa previa typically manifests as onset of hemorrhage at the time of amniotomy or spontaneous rupture of membranes. The hemorrhage is fetal blood, and exsanguination can occur rapidly because the average blood volume of a term fetus is approximately 250 mL. Rarely, vessels are palpated in the presenting membranes, prohibiting artificial rupture and vaginal delivery. If fetal heart tones are reassuring, a blood sample from the vaginal vault may be obtained to check for fetal blood cells or fetal hemoglobin. The Apt test is most commonly used; it is based on the resistance of fetal hemoglobin to denaturation by alkaline agents and can be performed in the labor and delivery unit. Delivery should not be deferred for confirmation of fetal blood in women with severe hemorrhage or when fetal heart tones are nonreassuring. There are no strategies for primary prevention of vasa previa; however, hemorrhage theoretically is preventable with antenatal screening for women at high risk and cesarean delivery at 37 to 38 weeks when vasa previa is present. Screening is carried out with transvaginal color-f low Doppler to identify the presence of vessels in the fetal membranes. Although it has been suggested for women at increased risk, there is no evidence that screening in a general population changes outcomes, and because the condition is rare (one diagnosis per 5,215 screenings), this approach is cost prohibitive.

Before the resurgence of the use of external version, the only choices for breech delivery were cesarean section or a trial of labor. It is preferable to wait until term (37 weeks of gestation) before external version is attempted because of an increased success rate and avoidance of preterm delivery if complications arise. After the fetal head is gently disengaged, the fetus is manipulated by a forward roll or back flip. If unsuccessful, the version can be reattempted at a later time. The procedure should only be performed in a facility equipped for emergency cesarean section. The use of external cephalic version can produce considerable cost savings in the management of the breech fetus at term. It is a skill easily acquired by family physicians and should be a routine part of obstetric practice. The incidence of breech presentation at term is about 4 percent. Multiple factors may cause a fetus to present breech instead of vertex, including placenta previa, multiple gestation, uterine anomalies, fetal anomalies, poor uterine tone and prematurity. The majority of cases have no apparent cause. Physicians performing external cephalic version (also referred to as external version) externally rotate the fetus from a breech presentation to a vertex presentation. Over the past 15 years, external cephalic version has become a valuable, although underused, option in the management of the breech fetus at term. Before the resurgence of the use of external cephalic version, management of breech presentation consisted of either routine cesarean delivery or a selected trial of labor. However, over the past two decades, theoretically for safety concerns regarding the fetus, the rate of cesarean delivery for breech presentation increased from 14 percent in 1970 to the current rate of up to 100 percent at some institutions. Very few trials of labor are being attempted. Approximately 12 percent of cesarean deliveries in the United States are performed for breech presentation. Breech presentation ranks as the third most frequent indication for cesarean section, following previous cesarean section and labor dystocia. Routine use of external version could reduce the rate of cesarean delivery by about two thirds. This article reviews the rationale for the use of external version and its technical aspects, including the currently accepted protocol and manual maneuvers, factors predicting success and cost-effectiveness. Abstract External version has apparently been practiced since the time of Aristotle (384 to 322 B.C.), who stated that many of his fellow authors advised midwives who were confronted with a breech presentation to “change the figure and place the head so that it may present at birth.” However, external version eventually fell out of favor as a result of several concerns: its high rate of spontaneous reversion (turning back to breech presentation) if performed before 36 weeks of gestation, possible fetal complications, and the assumption that an external version converts only those fetuses to vertex that would have converted spontaneously anyway. The rebirth of the use of external version occurred in the early 1980s in the United States, after a protocol developed in Berlin was replicated with favorable results in several U.S. studies. Consumer demands for more noninterventional birth experiences also played a role in its resurgence. Currently, external version is performed in many institutions, and the procedure is taught in most obstetric residency programs and in some family practice residency programs. The safety of vaginal breech delivery has been a longstanding controversy. In a recent retrospective study, investigators found that the risk of fetal morbidity and mortality is increased when vaginal delivery is attempted and concluded that cesarean section should be recommended routinely. In another study, however, investigators reached an opposite conclusion. They calculated a corrected perinatal mortality of zero based on a series of 316 women undergoing a trial of labor. Other studies have documented the success and safety of external version. The authors of a recent literature review of 25 studies on the efficacy of external cephalic version calculated an overall success rate of 63.3 percent, with a range of 48 to 77 percent. Most of these studies used the currently accepted protocol that is discussed in this article. These studies documented minimal risks, including umbilical cord entanglement, abruptio placenta, preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) and severe maternal discomfort. Overall complication rates have ranged from about 1 to 2 percent since 1979. In another study, fetal heart rate changes occurred in 39 percent of fetuses during external version attempts, but these changes were transient and had no relationship to the final outcome. Importantly, the literature provides overwhelmingly reassuring evidence regarding the risk of fetal death. Before 1980, four fetal deaths from external cephalic version had been reported. All of these deaths occurred in association with attempts at external version using general anesthesia. Since 1980, only two fetal deaths have been reported with external version. Both occurred without the use of fetal heart rate monitoring or ultrasonography in preterm infants in Zimbabwe. A recent study reported a success rate for external cephalic version of 69.5 percent. Noteworthy was the fact that among fetuses undergoing successful version, the incidence of intrapartum cesarean section was 16.9 percent, a figure that was 2.25 times higher than that in the control group. The high rate of cesarean delivery resulted from a significantly higher incidence of fetal distress and labor dystocia in the group receiving external version. Results of this study demonstrate that even after successful version, a higher rate of intrapartum abnormalities may occur. Prospective, randomized trials regarding vaginal breech delivery are not available and are unlikely to be carried out because of liability concerns. A consensus in the obstetric literature is lacking, and the optimal rate of cesarean section is likely to remain elusive and controversial. A policy of routine cesarean section eliminates the fetal risks, but considerably increases the risks of maternal morbidity. Neither option addresses the primary problem of the breech presentation, which the external version can answer in selected situations. Selection criteria for a safe attempt at vaginal breech delivery are listed in . When these criteria are applied, approximately 70 percent of women with a vaginal breech presentation will be candidates for attempted vaginal delivery. Of these, approximately two thirds will have a successful delivery. If inclusion criteria are routinely used, the calculated success rate for vaginal delivery of a fetus in the breech position is just over 40 percent. Or, conversely, about 60 percent of fetuses presenting in the breech position will be delivered by cesarean section despite optimal attempts to achieve a vaginal delivery.

Breech presentation. Curr Opin Obstet Gynecol 1993;5:664–8. Not only does external cephalic version significantly reduce the number of breech presentations at term, its use also reduces the high rate of cesarean delivery for this indication. Any reduction in the primary rate of cesarean delivery has an additive effect on the overall rate by decreasing the number of women undergoing repeat cesarean delivery. The major benefits of external cephalic version are reduced maternal morbidity and mortality from surgery. Abstract External version has an 80 percent success rate when performed in preterm gestations. Concomitantly, the spontaneous reversion rate is approximately 16 percent. It is surmised that the relatively small size of the preterm fetus is responsible for these high rates. A small fetus has more room to be turned and can revert on its own. At term (defined as 37 weeks or more of gestation), the success rate falls to 63 percent, but the reversion rate improves to 6 to 7 percent. The same rationale (the larger fetus has less freedom of movement) is responsible for these reduced rates. The most important reason to wait until the fetus is at term is to avoid iatrogenic prematurity if complications arise. If an external version attempt results in active labor, ruptured membranes or fetal compromise that requires cesarean section, and the fetus is at term, delivery can proceed without concerns about complications of prematurity. Complications resulting from an external version attempt in a preterm fetus could result in increased fetal morbidity and mortality. Because the incidence of PROM and pre-term labor is increased in breech presentations, it is crucial for the physician to diagnose the breech presentation as close to 37 weeks of gestation as possible and, ideally, by the 36th week. This early diagnosis allows lee-way for scheduling the external version and ultrasound examination. Otherwise, the opportunity to perform external version may be lost. Careful Leopold's maneuvers, followed by ultrasonography, must be diligently performed during third-trimester prenatal visits in order for diagnosis to be made early. An algorithm for external cephalic version is presented in . Abstract In general, candidates for external version should be low-risk patients at 37 weeks of gestation or more, by good dating criteria. The type of breech (either frank, complete or footling) is not a factor in determining suitability. Studies support the safety of external version in women who are candidates for vaginal birth after cesarean delivery (VBAC) and in women with a transverse lie. (The latter study was actually conducted intrapartum.) External version has been used successfully in VBAC candidates without any incidence of uterine rupture. In a small study, version was successfully performed on women presenting in labor with a transverse lie and intact membranes, reducing the cesarean section rate by 50 percent. External version has also been used safely and with very high success rates for the delivery of the second twin with non-vertex presentation, although the experience in this setting is too limited to recommend it as the method of choice. A recent study on successful external version in preterm pregnancies  involving 110 patients demonstrated an overall success rate of 79 percent, with no increased incidence of PROM, preterm labor or adverse fetal effects. The protocol in this study included repeat external version if spontaneous reversion occurred. All repeat attempts were successful in the preterm group. Most study authors, however, feel that external version is too risky in the preterm patient for the reasons previously mentioned. Physicians must be aware of exclusion criteria when determining the appropriateness of external version . Reprinted with permission from Amercian College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

An ultrasound machine and an experienced sonographer must be available. There must also be ready access to a facility equipped for cesarean delivery. Family physicians without privileges for cesarean section should only perform the procedure when obstetric backup is readily available. It is important that a formal protocol be followed in order to minimize the risk of complications. outlines one of several protocols used for external cephalic version. An Example of a Protocol for External Cephalic Version An ultrasound examination is performed to confirm breech position, determine amniotic fluid index, note placental location and rule out congenital anomalies and the presence of a nuchal cord. The patient should empty her bladder following the examination. A nonstress test is performed to confirm the absence of fetal heart rate abnormalities. Blood is drawn for a complete blood count, blood type and screen (in the event that an urgent cesarean section is necessary). A tocolytic agent such as terbutaline (Brethine), in a dosage of 0.25 mg, is administered subcutaneously. This is optional as its effectiveness in improving the success rate is equivocal. Under no circumstances should oral, parenteral or general anesthesia be used because of the increased risk of complications. The patient is placed in a supine or slight Trendelenburg position to facilitate disengagement/mobility of the breech. After the procedure (regardless of success or failure), a nonstress test and ultrasound examination are performed to exclude fetal bradycardia and to confirm successful version. Rh (D) immune globulin (Rhogam) is administered after the procedure to all Rh-negative patients because of a 4.1 percent risk of fetomaternal hemorrhage in these patients.

Abstract With the woman placed in the supine position, the abdomen is liberally coated with ultrasonic gel in order to decrease friction and lessen the chances of an overvigorous manipulation. External version can be performed by one or two persons experienced in the procedure. Initially, the degree of engagement of the presenting part should be determined and gentle disengagement performed if possible. This can be a key factor in achieving a successful outcome. It is actually the breech that is manipulated during the maneuver. The head is guided gently toward the pelvis as the breech is moved cephalad. Physicians can begin with the classic forward roll or the “back flip.” It probably does not matter which direction is chosen first, but most physicians tend to start with the forward roll . Some physicians, however, may base their preference on the position of the fetus. If the spine and head of the fetus are on the same side of the maternal midline, then the back flip may be attempted . If the spine and head are on opposite sides of the maternal midline, then the forward roll may be selected. If the first attempt is unsuccessful, a second attempt is usually made in the opposite direction. An alternative is to have a second person manipulate one of the fetal poles or elevate the breech through the vagina. In one study, an acoustic stimulator has been shown to facilitate change of the fetal spine from midline to lateral, consequently improving the chances of success. The breech should be mobilized. This may require a second person to vaginally disengage the breech. The breech should be mobilized. This may require a second person to vaginally disengage the breech. Forward roll: the breech should be disengaged and simultaneously pushed upward, gently guiding it vertex toward the pelvis. Forward roll: the breech should be disengaged and simultaneously pushed upward, gently guiding it vertex toward the pelvis. The breech should be mobilized and simultaneously pushed upward, gently guiding it vertex toward the pelvis. The breech should be mobilized and simultaneously pushed upward, gently guiding it vertex toward the pelvis. Emphasis should be on gentle persuasion of the fetus as opposed to forceful movements. Ranney, one of the modern pioneers in the technique, states, “one should approach the gentle art of external cephalic version with a flexible attitude. The brain, nerves, muscles and fingers of the obstetrician should be sensitively elastic. This is no place for a hasty or domineering approach, which is futile, and possibly dangerous.” Success is usually an all or nothing phenomenon and is attained quite easily if it is going to occur. In most recent studies, reports of successful version at term average about 65 percent. It is important to monitor the fetal heart rate with the ultrasound probe during and after attempts at external version. Reasons to discontinue attempted version include excessive maternal discomfort, repeated failure or evidence of fetal compromise on monitoring. Most women do not find the procedure to be painful. If fetal bradycardia is detected after a successful version, it is recommended that the infant be returned to its previous breech presentation in hopes of reducing the risk of a tangled cord. If an attempt is unsuccessful and no evidence of fetal compromise is found, it is safe and cost-effective to repeat external version several days to one week later. The risk of spontaneous reversion to a breech presentation following successful version is about 7 percent. However, one study has shown that training women to make regular self-assessment of the presenting part after successful external version could improve the ultimate rate of vaginal delivery through use of prompt repeat external version when reversion is detected before labor. One case report describes external version being performed successfully three times after spontaneous reversion, followed by induction of labor and a successful vaginal delivery. Abstract Diagnostic and treatment algorithms are being established for many conditions, and it is becoming essential to document the cost-effectiveness of medical therapies. Several studies have focused on the cost-effectiveness of external cephalic version. A recent decision analysis regarding the management of a breech pregnancy at term assumed a cost of $1,000 for external version based on California data. A strategy of routine external version for a breech presentation at term resulted in a savings of $1,473 per individual when compared with routine scheduling of a cesarean delivery. Another study using different cost data concluded that the use of external version would result in a savings of 12.3 percent per birth if it were applied routinely.

13842991-15e3-4fb5-80f7-4eefc005c7a7,"Pregnant women who underwent surgery for complicated appendicitis have significantly better outcomes Pregnant women who underwent immediate surgery to treat a ruptured or abscessed and their fetuses had significantly better outcomes than those whose condition was managed without an operation. Results from a nationwide study presented at the virtual American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2020 form the basis for the potential development of a consensus on optimal management of complicated appendicitis in pregnancy. Currently, the management of appendicitis in the general population is somewhat controversial and is especially true for complicated appendicitis. Increasing numbers of surgeons prefer a trial of nonsurgical management; others recommend an immediate operation,"" explained Kazuhide Matsushima, MD, FACS, an assistant professor of clinical surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California (USC), Los Angeles. This study is a great first step toward a consensus regarding the optimal management of complicated appendicitis in pregnant patients. Randomized clinical trials are necessary to provide that consensus."" Kazuhide Matsushima, MD, FACS, Assistant Professor, Department of Clinical Surgery, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California ""Based on the current evidence we have, which includes this study, our recommendation would be for surgeons to pursue immediate operation for pregnant patients with complicated appendicitis. Every day of delay to surgery means worse clinical outcomes for the patients as well as the fetus,"" said Vincent Cheng, MD, a general surgery resident and lead author of the study at USC. Since the 19th Century, surgery has been the most widely accepted treatment for appendicitis; more than 300,000 appendectomies are performed annually in the US. Laparoscopic appendectomy is the most common surgical treatment. Despite this history, the management of acute appendicitis is still open to debate in terms of such questions as the timing of appendectomy, the safety of in-hospital delay, and the indications for performing appendectomy following a course of antibiotics. Moreover, increasing numbers of patients in the U.S. are being treated for appendicitis non-operatively. The number has doubled in the last 20 years, according to results of a study presented at the American College of Surgeons Clinical Congress 2017. Appendicitis during pregnancy is relatively uncommon. While the raw number and incidence of appendicitis during pregnancy is low, it is actually the most common non-obstetric emergency during pregnancy. Exploring alternative diagnosis options for women with deep infiltrating endometriosis Renowned Harley Street hospital performs pioneering dual breast surgery Digital chest drainage systems could help reduce COVID-19 spread, research shows It is also the most common non-obstetric reason for surgery during pregnancy, Dr. Cheng said. About 0.1 percent of pregnant women have appendicitis; in one study, 25 percent of 713 pregnant patients with appendicitis had a perforated appendix. Nonetheless, the condition carries a high risk of serious complications, including loss of the fetus. Perforation of the appendix increases the risk of death of the mother. Because of the low incidence of complicated appendicitis in pregnancy, there are no specific recommendations or guidelines on management. A team of surgeons from USC therefore set out to evaluate current treatment of complicated appendicitis in pregnancy by comparing maternal and fetal complications after operative and non-operative management. The researchers reviewed the National Inpatient Sample dataset from 2003-2015 to identify 8,087 cases of complicated appendicitis in pregnancy. Most (55 percent) had immediate non-invasive surgery. Forty-five percent began a course of non-operative management, which involved a course of antibiotics with or without percutaneous drainage of the inflamed organ. Of the 45 percent of patients who began non-operative management, 74 percent failed and later required an operation (either a laparoscopic procedure or an open appendectomy). Preterm labor, delivery, and pregnancy termination were more common in the group of women who had non-operative management or delayed surgery than in those who had immediate surgery; the odds of developing these complications were one to three times higher for the non-operative group. Sepsis also was two to four times more common in these groups of patients. The rate of any complication was lowest among patients who had immediate surgery (30 percent) and overall length of stay was two days shorter for these patients. While further study is needed to eventually arrive at a consensus for treating complicated appendicitis in pregnancy, findings from the study may help guide surgeons and patients. Dr. Matsushima stressed the importance of telling patients that the management of this condition is controversial and explaining the treatment options and risks. Dr. Cheng pointed out that ""every situation is different and every patient is different so the discussion about how to manage this disease process should be a joint process between the patient and the surgeon that presents the pros and cons of the treatment options.""

The average duration of pregnancy is about 280 days. Estimation of the date on which delivery should occur is based on the first day of the last menstrual period.SEE: ; SEE TABLE: ; SEE: ; SEE: ; Nursing Diagnoses AppendixAbout 7 million American women become pregnant each year, and about two thirds of these pregnancies result in live births. In 2009, there were 4,143,000 live births in the U.S.Presumptive and probable signs are those commonly associated with pregnancy but may be due to other causes, such as oral contraceptive therapy. include amenorrhea, nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness, urinary frequency, fatigue, chloasma, vaginal hyperemia (Chadwick sign), and “quickening.” include increased abdominal girth, palpable fetal outline, softening of the lower uterine segment (Hegar sign), softening of the cervix (Goodell sign), and immunodiagnostic pregnancy tests. of pregnancy are auscultation of fetal heart sounds, fetal movements felt by the examiner, and an identifiable embryonic outline on ultrasound.The pregnant woman experiences many physiological alterations related to the increased levels of estrogen and progesterone and to the demands of the growing fetus; every system in the woman's body responds to these changes. Alterations in uterine size, shape, and consistency include an increase in uterine muscle mass over the months of pregnancy. In response to elevated estrogen and progesterone levels, the cervix and lower uterine segment soften. A thick mucous plug fills the cervical canal. Vaginal secretions increase, and vaginal pH is more acidic (pH = 3.5 to 6.0). Change in vaginal pH discourages the survival and multiplication of bacteria; however, it also encourages infection by . The vagina elongates as the uterus rises in the pelvis; the mucosa thickens, with increases in secretions, vascularity, and elasticity.SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: The breasts become enlarged, tender, and more nodular. The areolae darken; the nipples become more sensitive and erectile; and Montgomery's tubercles enlarge. Colostrum may leak out during the last trimester, as the breasts prepare for lactation. The size and activity of the thyroid gland increase markedly. Levels of thyroid-binding globulin and triiodothyronine rise; levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone drop slightly. These changes allow the pregnant woman to meet the endocrine needs imposed by the developing fetus, and other body changes that occur during pregnancy. Pituitary activity increases; prolactin levels increase ensuring lactation; placental hormones prevent ovulation and encourage development of the corpus luteum. Parathyroid activity decreases during the first trimester, then increases throughout the pregnancy to meet the increasing calcium demands of the fetus. Insulin resistance increases; this poses a risk, for some women, of glucose intolerance or gestational diabetes mellitus. Circulating blood volume increases progressively throughout pregnancy, peaking in the middle of the third trimester. Although the red blood cell count rises by about 30%, a 50% increase in blood volume creates dilutional anemia. The lower relative hematocrit decreases the viscosity of the blood. However, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g is usually due to iron deficiency. Rising levels of clotting factors VII, VIII, IX, X, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor increase coagulability. The pulse rate increases, along with cardiac stroke volume. Peripheral vascular resistance drops. Mid-trimester blood pressure may be slightly lower than normal but remains essentially unchanged. Softening and increased mobility of the pelvic articulations is reflected in the waddling gait of pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, the woman's center of gravity shifts, and the lumbar curve increases to compensate for the growing anterior weight of the gravid uterus. Problems with dental caries may become more prominent during pregnancy but can be prevented with oral rinses (such as chlorhexidine) and regular brushing and flossing. The effects of progesterone on smooth muscle include a decreased airway resistance, which enables the woman to meet her increased needs for oxygen by permitting a 30% to 40% increase in tidal volume and a 15% to 20% rise in oxygen consumption. The effects of estrogen include edema and congestion of the nasal mucosa, reflected in nosebleeds and nasal stuffiness. Nausea and vomiting are the most common complaints during the first trimester. Progesterone-related diminished motility contributes to common complaints of heartburn and constipation. Hemorrhoids are common, caused by increased pressure in the lower pelvis and constipation. Alterations in T helper cell dominance produce immunological tolerance for the fetus and the placenta, both of which contain antigens that are alien to the mother. During pregnancy, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus tend to become less active. Pigmentation changes in pregnancy include chloasma (the mask of pregnancy), areolar darkening, and linea nigra (a pigmented line that vertically bisects the abdomen). They reflect estrogen-related stimulation of skin melanocytes. Striae gravidarum, stretch marks, may appear in the skin of the abdomen, breasts, and thighs. By the middle of the first trimester, the glomerular filtration rate has risen by about 50%; in compensation, tubular reabsorption also increases. Although urinary frequency is common in the first and last trimesters, bladder capacity actually increases; however, pressure from the growing uterus reduces the volume required to stimulate voiding. During the second trimester, the uterus rises out of the pelvis, becoming an abdominal organ and relieving bladder compression until late in the third trimester. In average-sized women, the expected first-trimester weight gain is 2 to 5 lb. Total weight gain and the pattern by which it increases should be monitored to enable early signs of pregnancy-related problems common to the particular point in gestation. The Institute of Medicine recommends the following weight gains during singleton pregnancies: a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index less than 19.8 should gain 25 to 39 lb (11.4 to 17.7 kg); a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index from 19.8 to 26 should gain 25 to 34 lb (11.4 to 15.5 kg); and a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index from 26 to 29 should gain 15 to 24 lb (6.8 to 10.9 kg). The recommended weight gains during pregnancy are different for multiple gestations, e.g., a woman carrying triplets should gain about 50 lb (22.7 kg) during her pregnancy.A pregnancy test, either urine or blood sample is taken, determines whether a woman is pregnant. Markers that indicate pregnancy, e.g., human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), are found in the blood and urine.An essential component to anticipatory guidance and patient teaching is to encourage the woman's active participation in her own health maintenance and pregnancy progress. Health care providers describe to pregnant women common complaints related to normal physiological changes of pregnancy and suggest actions to minimize discomfort. Hormone-related delayed gastric emptying, cardiac sphincter relaxation, and stomach displacement by the growing uterus contribute to reflux. The use of low-sodium or combination aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide preparations is recommended for symptomatic relief. For severe, unresponsive heartburn, over-the-counter H2-recedptor antagonists, such as ranitidine (Zantac) or famotidine (Pepcid), may be recommended. The woman should increase fiber and fluid intake. She also may use stool softeners. The woman may relieve the so-called charley horse that occurs during sleep by dorsiflexing the foot of the affected leg. A calcium-phosphorus imbalance may contribute to increased frequency of this problem, although the causes are not clear. The woman can increase calcium intake by drinking the recommended daily quart of milk or by drinking a pint of milk daily and taking a calcium supplement with vitamin D. Growing anterior mass, shift in center of gravity, and increased lumbar curve contribute to backaches. To relieve discomfort, the pregnant woman should wear well-fitting, low-heeled shoes and perform exercises that increase abdominal muscle tone. Pedal edema is a common third-trimester complaint related to decreased venous return from the extremities. The woman is advised to rest frequently and to elevate her feet. She should report promptly any edema of the face, hands, or sacral area to facilitate early diagnosis and management of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Decreased venous return from the extremities and compression of vascular structures by the growing uterus aggravate any weakness in the vascular walls and valves. Varicosities often occur in the legs, vulva, and pelvis. The woman should avoid tight clothing and prolonged standing. Other preventive and therapeutic measures include wearing support stockings, resting in left Sim position, and elevating the lower limbs during sleep. Temporary symptomatic relief may be obtained by Sitz baths and analgesic ointments. The woman also should be instructed in how to reinsert the hemorrhoid with a well-lubricated finger, holding it in place for 1 to 2 min before releasing the pressure. A normal increase in vaginal discharge occurs during pregnancy. Common perineal hygiene usually is effective as a comfort measure; douching is contraindicated during pregnancy. The woman should contact her primary caregiver promptly if profuse, malodorous, or blood-tinged discharge occurs. Shortness of breath occurs as the growing uterus presses on the woman's diaphragm. Elevation of the head and shoulders may provide some relief. The dyspnea disappears when lightening occurs. The normal stretching of the skin may generate itching on the breasts, abdomen, and vulva. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy is the most common benign dermatosis of pregnancy. Occurring in the third trimester, it usually resolves spontaneously after delivery. If severe, topical emollients, steroids, and antihistamines may provide some relief. Use of an emollient lotion may be suggested; the patient is instructed to inform her primary caregiver if vulvovaginal itching occurs in conjunction with an increase or alteration in vaginal discharge.A woman's nutritional status before and during pregnancy is an important factor that affects both her health and that of her unborn child. Nutritional assessment is an essential part of antepartal care. In addition, the presence of preexisting and coexisting disorders, such as anemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and phenylketonuria, may affect dietary recommendations. Substance abuse increases the risk of inadequate nutrition, low maternal weight gain, low-birth-weight infants, and perinatal mortality.Dietary recommendations emphasize a high-quality, well-balanced diet. Increased amounts of essential nutrients, i.e., protein, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium, B vitamins, vitamin C, folate, and iron, are necessary to meet nutritional needs of both mother and fetus. Most nutritional and metabolic needs can be met by eating a balanced daily diet containing approx. 35 kcal for each kilogram of optimal body weight plus an additional 300 kcal/day during the second and third trimesters. Because it is difficult to meet all the daily dietary recommendations, vitamin and iron supplements are recommended. Preparing for travel during pregnancy will depend upon the number of weeks' gestation, the duration of the travel, and the method, i.e., auto, boat, bus, train, airplane.Safety belts, preferably the combined lap and shoulder type, should be worn with the lap portion below the pregnant abdomen not across it. If nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a factor, travel by sea isn't advisable. If anti-motion-sickness medication is used, it should be one approved for use during pregnancy (or antinausea wrist bands may be used). Travel during the last part of pregnancy is not advised unless obstetrical care is available at the destination(s). It is important to carry a copy of current medical records when traveling. Travel abroad should be discussed with the obstetrician so that appropriate immunizations can be given. For travel in an area known to be endemic for malaria, certain drugs will be needed for prophylaxis.Live virus immunization should not be administered during pregnancy. Healthy pregnant women who are employed in jobs that present no more risk than those in daily life are encouraged to continue working if they desire until shortly before delivery. If the pregnancy is progressing normally, exercise should be continued. The amount and type of exercise is an individual matter. A woman who has exercised regularly before her pregnancy should experience no difficulty with continuing; however, a previously sedentary woman should not attempt to institute a vigorous exercise program such as long-distance running or jogging during her pregnancy. No matter what the type of exercise, it is important to remember that, with the progress of pregnancy, the center of gravity will change and probably prevent participation at the same level and skill as before pregnancy. Sports to avoid include water skiing, horseback riding, and scuba diving. In horseback riding, in addition to the possibility of falling from the horse, the repeated bouncing may lead to bruising of the perianal area. Scuba diving may lead to decompression sickness and bends and to intravascular air embolism in the fetus. Women who breast-feed their children should continue exercising if they maintain hydration and adequate breast support. Women who are experiencing normally progressing pregnancies need not avoid intercourse. Pregnant women should refrain from coitus if they have a history of preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes and if they are bleeding or have ruptured membranes. Common tests include blood tests for nutritional or sickle cell anemia, blood type and Rh factor, rubella titers, syphilis, and serum alpha-fetoprotein for the presence of neural tube defects such as spina bifida. Additional testing may include determining HIV status and hepatitis immunity. Ultrasound may be used to determine age, rate of growth, position, some birth defects, and fetal sex. Chorionic villus sampling may be done early in pregnancy if the family history indicates potential for genetic diseases. Second trimester amniocentesis may be used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders, and fetal sex. In late pregnancy, nonstress tests, contraction stress tests, and fetal biophysical profiles may be done; amniocentesis may be done to evaluate fetal lung maturity. SEE TABLE: Influenza vaccination is recommended during pregnancy Although pregnancy among teenagers is decreasing in the U.S., approx. 7% of all American teenage girls still become pregnant in any given year, one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in developed countries. Sociocultural factors are believed to contribute to the high incidence of pregnancies among this population. Demographic data indicate that teenage pregnancy is more likely to be associated with being single, having low socioeconomic status, and lacking social support systems. Pregnant teenagers are believed to be at high risk for some complications of pregnancy; if, however, they seek prenatal care early and consistently cooperate with recommendations, the risk is comparable to that for other age groups. Clinical data identify a common pattern of late entry to the prenatal care system, failure to return for scheduled appointments, and noncompliance with medical and nursing recommendations. As a result of these behaviors, adolescents are at higher risk for pregnancy-related complications, such as iron-deficiency anemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm labor and delivery, low birthweight newborns, and cephalopelvic disproportion. Other health problems seen more commonly in pregnant adolescents include sexually transmitted diseases and substance abuse.SEE: ; Nursing Diagnoses Appendix A growing number of women are experiencing their first pregnancies after age 35. The incidence of fetal demise among this population is 6:1000 births, double the rate for women under 35. Many factors may contribute to the increased risk, including preexisting and coexisting conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and uterine fibroids. Mature women are identified as being at higher risk for spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, placenta previa, gestational diabetes, cesarean birth, and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. Multiple-gestation secondary assisted reproduction also may be a factor in fetal loss. Very rarely, postmenopausal women have become pregnant through embryo donation and have successfully carried the pregnancy to term delivery. Prior to undergoing this procedure, the women had been undergoing hormone replacement therapy. Previously, it had been assumed that the postmenopausal uterus would not be capable of supporting the growth and development of an embryo. Pregnancies in older women are considered high risk for reasons similar to those related to mature pregnancy. Late in the third trimester, the woman may be instructed to keep a fetal activity record and undergo regularly scheduled nonstress tests. • Assessment of pregnant women for alcohol misuse and tobacco use • Chlamydia and gonorrhea (antigen or culture) tests -- To view the remaining sections of this topic, please or -- (preg′năn-sē ) [L. , with child, pregnant] The condition of having a developing embryo or fetus in the body after successful conception.

The woman also should be instructed in how to reinsert the hemorrhoid with a well-lubricated finger, holding it in place for 1 to 2 min before releasing the pressure. A normal increase in vaginal discharge occurs during pregnancy. Common perineal hygiene usually is effective as a comfort measure; douching is contraindicated during pregnancy. The woman should contact her primary caregiver promptly if profuse, malodorous, or blood-tinged discharge occurs. Shortness of breath occurs as the growing uterus presses on the woman's diaphragm. Elevation of the head and shoulders may provide some relief. The dyspnea disappears when lightening occurs. The normal stretching of the skin may generate itching on the breasts, abdomen, and vulva. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy is the most common benign dermatosis of pregnancy. Occurring in the third trimester, it usually resolves spontaneously after delivery. If severe, topical emollients, steroids, and antihistamines may provide some relief. Use of an emollient lotion may be suggested; the patient is instructed to inform her primary caregiver if vulvovaginal itching occurs in conjunction with an increase or alteration in vaginal discharge.A woman's nutritional status before and during pregnancy is an important factor that affects both her health and that of her unborn child. Nutritional assessment is an essential part of antepartal care. In addition, the presence of preexisting and coexisting disorders, such as anemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and phenylketonuria, may affect dietary recommendations. Substance abuse increases the risk of inadequate nutrition, low maternal weight gain, low-birth-weight infants, and perinatal mortality.Dietary recommendations emphasize a high-quality, well-balanced diet. Increased amounts of essential nutrients, i.e., protein, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium, B vitamins, vitamin C, folate, and iron, are necessary to meet nutritional needs of both mother and fetus. Most nutritional and metabolic needs can be met by eating a balanced daily diet containing approx. 35 kcal for each kilogram of optimal body weight plus an additional 300 kcal/day during the second and third trimesters. Because it is difficult to meet all the daily dietary recommendations, vitamin and iron supplements are recommended. Preparing for travel during pregnancy will depend upon the number of weeks' gestation, the duration of the travel, and the method, i.e., auto, boat, bus, train, airplane.Safety belts, preferably the combined lap and shoulder type, should be worn with the lap portion below the pregnant abdomen not across it. If nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a factor, travel by sea isn't advisable. If anti-motion-sickness medication is used, it should be one approved for use during pregnancy (or antinausea wrist bands may be used). Travel during the last part of pregnancy is not advised unless obstetrical care is available at the destination(s). It is important to carry a copy of current medical records when traveling. Travel abroad should be discussed with the obstetrician so that appropriate immunizations can be given. For travel in an area known to be endemic for malaria, certain drugs will be needed for prophylaxis.Live virus immunization should not be administered during pregnancy. Healthy pregnant women who are employed in jobs that present no more risk than those in daily life are encouraged to continue working if they desire until shortly before delivery. If the pregnancy is progressing normally, exercise should be continued. The amount and type of exercise is an individual matter. A woman who has exercised regularly before her pregnancy should experience no difficulty with continuing; however, a previously sedentary woman should not attempt to institute a vigorous exercise program such as long-distance running or jogging during her pregnancy. No matter what the type of exercise, it is important to remember that, with the progress of pregnancy, the center of gravity will change and probably prevent participation at the same level and skill as before pregnancy. Sports to avoid include water skiing, horseback riding, and scuba diving. In horseback riding, in addition to the possibility of falling from the horse, the repeated bouncing may lead to bruising of the perianal area. Scuba diving may lead to decompression sickness and bends and to intravascular air embolism in the fetus. Women who breast-feed their children should continue exercising if they maintain hydration and adequate breast support. Women who are experiencing normally progressing pregnancies need not avoid intercourse. Pregnant women should refrain from coitus if they have a history of preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes and if they are bleeding or have ruptured membranes. Common tests include blood tests for nutritional or sickle cell anemia, blood type and Rh factor, rubella titers, syphilis, and serum alpha-fetoprotein for the presence of neural tube defects such as spina bifida. Additional testing may include determining HIV status and hepatitis immunity. Ultrasound may be used to determine age, rate of growth, position, some birth defects, and fetal sex. Chorionic villus sampling may be done early in pregnancy if the family history indicates potential for genetic diseases. Second trimester amniocentesis may be used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders, and fetal sex. In late pregnancy, nonstress tests, contraction stress tests, and fetal biophysical profiles may be done; amniocentesis may be done to evaluate fetal lung maturity. SEE TABLE: Influenza vaccination is recommended during pregnancy Although pregnancy among teenagers is decreasing in the U.S., approx. 7% of all American teenage girls still become pregnant in any given year, one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in developed countries. Sociocultural factors are believed to contribute to the high incidence of pregnancies among this population. Demographic data indicate that teenage pregnancy is more likely to be associated with being single, having low socioeconomic status, and lacking social support systems. Pregnant teenagers are believed to be at high risk for some complications of pregnancy; if, however, they seek prenatal care early and consistently cooperate with recommendations, the risk is comparable to that for other age groups. Clinical data identify a common pattern of late entry to the prenatal care system, failure to return for scheduled appointments, and noncompliance with medical and nursing recommendations. As a result of these behaviors, adolescents are at higher risk for pregnancy-related complications, such as iron-deficiency anemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm labor and delivery, low birthweight newborns, and cephalopelvic disproportion. Other health problems seen more commonly in pregnant adolescents include sexually transmitted diseases and substance abuse.SEE: ; Nursing Diagnoses Appendix A growing number of women are experiencing their first pregnancies after age 35. The incidence of fetal demise among this population is 6:1000 births, double the rate for women under 35. Many factors may contribute to the increased risk, including preexisting and coexisting conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and uterine fibroids. Mature women are identified as being at higher risk for spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, placenta previa, gestational diabetes, cesarean birth, and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. Multiple-gestation secondary assisted reproduction also may be a factor in fetal loss. Very rarely, postmenopausal women have become pregnant through embryo donation and have successfully carried the pregnancy to term delivery. Prior to undergoing this procedure, the women had been undergoing hormone replacement therapy. Previously, it had been assumed that the postmenopausal uterus would not be capable of supporting the growth and development of an embryo. Pregnancies in older women are considered high risk for reasons similar to those related to mature pregnancy. Late in the third trimester, the woman may be instructed to keep a fetal activity record and undergo regularly scheduled nonstress tests. • Assessment of pregnant women for alcohol misuse and tobacco use • Chlamydia and gonorrhea (antigen or culture) tests There's more to see -- the rest of this entry is available only to subscribers.

The average duration of pregnancy is about 280 days. Estimation of the date on which delivery should occur is based on the first day of the last menstrual period.SEE: ; SEE TABLE: ; SEE: ; SEE: ; Nursing Diagnoses AppendixAbout 7 million American women become pregnant each year, and about two thirds of these pregnancies result in live births. In 2009, there were 4,143,000 live births in the U.S.Presumptive and probable signs are those commonly associated with pregnancy but may be due to other causes, such as oral contraceptive therapy. include amenorrhea, nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness, urinary frequency, fatigue, chloasma, vaginal hyperemia (Chadwick sign), and “quickening.” include increased abdominal girth, palpable fetal outline, softening of the lower uterine segment (Hegar sign), softening of the cervix (Goodell sign), and immunodiagnostic pregnancy tests. of pregnancy are auscultation of fetal heart sounds, fetal movements felt by the examiner, and an identifiable embryonic outline on ultrasound.The pregnant woman experiences many physiological alterations related to the increased levels of estrogen and progesterone and to the demands of the growing fetus; every system in the woman's body responds to these changes. Alterations in uterine size, shape, and consistency include an increase in uterine muscle mass over the months of pregnancy. In response to elevated estrogen and progesterone levels, the cervix and lower uterine segment soften. A thick mucous plug fills the cervical canal. Vaginal secretions increase, and vaginal pH is more acidic (pH = 3.5 to 6.0). Change in vaginal pH discourages the survival and multiplication of bacteria; however, it also encourages infection by . The vagina elongates as the uterus rises in the pelvis; the mucosa thickens, with increases in secretions, vascularity, and elasticity.SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: The breasts become enlarged, tender, and more nodular. The areolae darken; the nipples become more sensitive and erectile; and Montgomery's tubercles enlarge. Colostrum may leak out during the last trimester, as the breasts prepare for lactation. The size and activity of the thyroid gland increase markedly. Levels of thyroid-binding globulin and triiodothyronine rise; levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone drop slightly. These changes allow the pregnant woman to meet the endocrine needs imposed by the developing fetus, and other body changes that occur during pregnancy. Pituitary activity increases; prolactin levels increase ensuring lactation; placental hormones prevent ovulation and encourage development of the corpus luteum. Parathyroid activity decreases during the first trimester, then increases throughout the pregnancy to meet the increasing calcium demands of the fetus. Insulin resistance increases; this poses a risk, for some women, of glucose intolerance or gestational diabetes mellitus. Circulating blood volume increases progressively throughout pregnancy, peaking in the middle of the third trimester. Although the red blood cell count rises by about 30%, a 50% increase in blood volume creates dilutional anemia. The lower relative hematocrit decreases the viscosity of the blood. However, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g is usually due to iron deficiency. Rising levels of clotting factors VII, VIII, IX, X, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor increase coagulability. The pulse rate increases, along with cardiac stroke volume. Peripheral vascular resistance drops. Mid-trimester blood pressure may be slightly lower than normal but remains essentially unchanged. Softening and increased mobility of the pelvic articulations is reflected in the waddling gait of pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, the woman's center of gravity shifts, and the lumbar curve increases to compensate for the growing anterior weight of the gravid uterus. Problems with dental caries may become more prominent during pregnancy but can be prevented with oral rinses (such as chlorhexidine) and regular brushing and flossing. The effects of progesterone on smooth muscle include a decreased airway resistance, which enables the woman to meet her increased needs for oxygen by permitting a 30% to 40% increase in tidal volume and a 15% to 20% rise in oxygen consumption. The effects of estrogen include edema and congestion of the nasal mucosa, reflected in nosebleeds and nasal stuffiness. Nausea and vomiting are the most common complaints during the first trimester. Progesterone-related diminished motility contributes to common complaints of heartburn and constipation. Hemorrhoids are common, caused by increased pressure in the lower pelvis and constipation. Alterations in T helper cell dominance produce immunological tolerance for the fetus and the placenta, both of which contain antigens that are alien to the mother. During pregnancy, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus tend to become less active. Pigmentation changes in pregnancy include chloasma (the mask of pregnancy), areolar darkening, and linea nigra (a pigmented line that vertically bisects the abdomen). They reflect estrogen-related stimulation of skin melanocytes. Striae gravidarum, stretch marks, may appear in the skin of the abdomen, breasts, and thighs. By the middle of the first trimester, the glomerular filtration rate has risen by about 50%; in compensation, tubular reabsorption also increases. Although urinary frequency is common in the first and last trimesters, bladder capacity actually increases; however, pressure from the growing uterus reduces the volume required to stimulate voiding. During the second trimester, the uterus rises out of the pelvis, becoming an abdominal organ and relieving bladder compression until late in the third trimester. In average-sized women, the expected first-trimester weight gain is 2 to 5 lb. Total weight gain and the pattern by which it increases should be monitored to enable early signs of pregnancy-related problems common to the particular point in gestation. The Institute of Medicine recommends the following weight gains during singleton pregnancies: a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index less than 19.8 should gain 25 to 39 lb (11.4 to 17.7 kg); a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index from 19.8 to 26 should gain 25 to 34 lb (11.4 to 15.5 kg); and a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index from 26 to 29 should gain 15 to 24 lb (6.8 to 10.9 kg). The recommended weight gains during pregnancy are different for multiple gestations, e.g., a woman carrying triplets should gain about 50 lb (22.7 kg) during her pregnancy.A pregnancy test, either urine or blood sample is taken, determines whether a woman is pregnant. Markers that indicate pregnancy, e.g., human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), are found in the blood and urine.An essential component to anticipatory guidance and patient teaching is to encourage the woman's active participation in her own health maintenance and pregnancy progress. Health care providers describe to pregnant women common complaints related to normal physiological changes of pregnancy and suggest actions to minimize discomfort. Hormone-related delayed gastric emptying, cardiac sphincter relaxation, and stomach displacement by the growing uterus contribute to reflux. The use of low-sodium or combination aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide preparations is recommended for symptomatic relief. For severe, unresponsive heartburn, over-the-counter H2-recedptor antagonists, such as ranitidine (Zantac) or famotidine (Pepcid), may be recommended. The woman should increase fiber and fluid intake. She also may use stool softeners. The woman may relieve the so-called charley horse that occurs during sleep by dorsiflexing the foot of the affected leg. A calcium-phosphorus imbalance may contribute to increased frequency of this problem, although the causes are not clear. The woman can increase calcium intake by drinking the recommended daily quart of milk or by drinking a pint of milk daily and taking a calcium supplement with vitamin D. Growing anterior mass, shift in center of gravity, and increased lumbar curve contribute to backaches. To relieve discomfort, the pregnant woman should wear well-fitting, low-heeled shoes and perform exercises that increase abdominal muscle tone. Pedal edema is a common third-trimester complaint related to decreased venous return from the extremities. The woman is advised to rest frequently and to elevate her feet. She should report promptly any edema of the face, hands, or sacral area to facilitate early diagnosis and management of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Decreased venous return from the extremities and compression of vascular structures by the growing uterus aggravate any weakness in the vascular walls and valves. Varicosities often occur in the legs, vulva, and pelvis. The woman should avoid tight clothing and prolonged standing. Other preventive and therapeutic measures include wearing support stockings, resting in left Sim position, and elevating the lower limbs during sleep. Temporary symptomatic relief may be obtained by Sitz baths and analgesic ointments. The woman also should be instructed in how to reinsert the hemorrhoid with a well-lubricated finger, holding it in place for 1 to 2 min before releasing the pressure. A normal increase in vaginal discharge occurs during pregnancy. Common perineal hygiene usually is effective as a comfort measure; douching is contraindicated during pregnancy. The woman should contact her primary caregiver promptly if profuse, malodorous, or blood-tinged discharge occurs. Shortness of breath occurs as the growing uterus presses on the woman's diaphragm. Elevation of the head and shoulders may provide some relief. The dyspnea disappears when lightening occurs. The normal stretching of the skin may generate itching on the breasts, abdomen, and vulva. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy is the most common benign dermatosis of pregnancy. Occurring in the third trimester, it usually resolves spontaneously after delivery. If severe, topical emollients, steroids, and antihistamines may provide some relief. Use of an emollient lotion may be suggested; the patient is instructed to inform her primary caregiver if vulvovaginal itching occurs in conjunction with an increase or alteration in vaginal discharge.A woman's nutritional status before and during pregnancy is an important factor that affects both her health and that of her unborn child. Nutritional assessment is an essential part of antepartal care. In addition, the presence of preexisting and coexisting disorders, such as anemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and phenylketonuria, may affect dietary recommendations. Substance abuse increases the risk of inadequate nutrition, low maternal weight gain, low-birth-weight infants, and perinatal mortality.Dietary recommendations emphasize a high-quality, well-balanced diet. Increased amounts of essential nutrients, i.e., protein, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium, B vitamins, vitamin C, folate, and iron, are necessary to meet nutritional needs of both mother and fetus.

Elevation of the head and shoulders may provide some relief. The dyspnea disappears when lightening occurs. The normal stretching of the skin may generate itching on the breasts, abdomen, and vulva. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy is the most common benign dermatosis of pregnancy. Occurring in the third trimester, it usually resolves spontaneously after delivery. If severe, topical emollients, steroids, and antihistamines may provide some relief. Use of an emollient lotion may be suggested; the patient is instructed to inform her primary caregiver if vulvovaginal itching occurs in conjunction with an increase or alteration in vaginal discharge.A woman's nutritional status before and during pregnancy is an important factor that affects both her health and that of her unborn child. Nutritional assessment is an essential part of antepartal care. In addition, the presence of preexisting and coexisting disorders, such as anemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and phenylketonuria, may affect dietary recommendations. Substance abuse increases the risk of inadequate nutrition, low maternal weight gain, low-birth-weight infants, and perinatal mortality.Dietary recommendations emphasize a high-quality, well-balanced diet. Increased amounts of essential nutrients, i.e., protein, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium, B vitamins, vitamin C, folate, and iron, are necessary to meet nutritional needs of both mother and fetus. Most nutritional and metabolic needs can be met by eating a balanced daily diet containing approx. 35 kcal for each kilogram of optimal body weight plus an additional 300 kcal/day during the second and third trimesters. Because it is difficult to meet all the daily dietary recommendations, vitamin and iron supplements are recommended. Preparing for travel during pregnancy will depend upon the number of weeks' gestation, the duration of the travel, and the method, i.e., auto, boat, bus, train, airplane.Safety belts, preferably the combined lap and shoulder type, should be worn with the lap portion below the pregnant abdomen not across it. If nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a factor, travel by sea isn't advisable. If anti-motion-sickness medication is used, it should be one approved for use during pregnancy (or antinausea wrist bands may be used). Travel during the last part of pregnancy is not advised unless obstetrical care is available at the destination(s). It is important to carry a copy of current medical records when traveling. Travel abroad should be discussed with the obstetrician so that appropriate immunizations can be given. For travel in an area known to be endemic for malaria, certain drugs will be needed for prophylaxis.Live virus immunization should not be administered during pregnancy. Healthy pregnant women who are employed in jobs that present no more risk than those in daily life are encouraged to continue working if they desire until shortly before delivery. If the pregnancy is progressing normally, exercise should be continued. The amount and type of exercise is an individual matter. A woman who has exercised regularly before her pregnancy should experience no difficulty with continuing; however, a previously sedentary woman should not attempt to institute a vigorous exercise program such as long-distance running or jogging during her pregnancy. No matter what the type of exercise, it is important to remember that, with the progress of pregnancy, the center of gravity will change and probably prevent participation at the same level and skill as before pregnancy. Sports to avoid include water skiing, horseback riding, and scuba diving. In horseback riding, in addition to the possibility of falling from the horse, the repeated bouncing may lead to bruising of the perianal area. Scuba diving may lead to decompression sickness and bends and to intravascular air embolism in the fetus. Women who breast-feed their children should continue exercising if they maintain hydration and adequate breast support. Women who are experiencing normally progressing pregnancies need not avoid intercourse. Pregnant women should refrain from coitus if they have a history of preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes and if they are bleeding or have ruptured membranes. Common tests include blood tests for nutritional or sickle cell anemia, blood type and Rh factor, rubella titers, syphilis, and serum alpha-fetoprotein for the presence of neural tube defects such as spina bifida. Additional testing may include determining HIV status and hepatitis immunity. Ultrasound may be used to determine age, rate of growth, position, some birth defects, and fetal sex. Chorionic villus sampling may be done early in pregnancy if the family history indicates potential for genetic diseases. Second trimester amniocentesis may be used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders, and fetal sex. In late pregnancy, nonstress tests, contraction stress tests, and fetal biophysical profiles may be done; amniocentesis may be done to evaluate fetal lung maturity. SEE TABLE: Influenza vaccination is recommended during pregnancy Although pregnancy among teenagers is decreasing in the U.S., approx. 7% of all American teenage girls still become pregnant in any given year, one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in developed countries. Sociocultural factors are believed to contribute to the high incidence of pregnancies among this population. Demographic data indicate that teenage pregnancy is more likely to be associated with being single, having low socioeconomic status, and lacking social support systems. Pregnant teenagers are believed to be at high risk for some complications of pregnancy; if, however, they seek prenatal care early and consistently cooperate with recommendations, the risk is comparable to that for other age groups. Clinical data identify a common pattern of late entry to the prenatal care system, failure to return for scheduled appointments, and noncompliance with medical and nursing recommendations. As a result of these behaviors, adolescents are at higher risk for pregnancy-related complications, such as iron-deficiency anemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm labor and delivery, low birthweight newborns, and cephalopelvic disproportion. Other health problems seen more commonly in pregnant adolescents include sexually transmitted diseases and substance abuse.SEE: ; Nursing Diagnoses Appendix A growing number of women are experiencing their first pregnancies after age 35. The incidence of fetal demise among this population is 6:1000 births, double the rate for women under 35. Many factors may contribute to the increased risk, including preexisting and coexisting conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and uterine fibroids. Mature women are identified as being at higher risk for spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, placenta previa, gestational diabetes, cesarean birth, and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. Multiple-gestation secondary assisted reproduction also may be a factor in fetal loss. Very rarely, postmenopausal women have become pregnant through embryo donation and have successfully carried the pregnancy to term delivery. Prior to undergoing this procedure, the women had been undergoing hormone replacement therapy. Previously, it had been assumed that the postmenopausal uterus would not be capable of supporting the growth and development of an embryo. Pregnancies in older women are considered high risk for reasons similar to those related to mature pregnancy. Late in the third trimester, the woman may be instructed to keep a fetal activity record and undergo regularly scheduled nonstress tests. • Assessment of pregnant women for alcohol misuse and tobacco use • Chlamydia and gonorrhea (antigen or culture) tests There's more to see -- the rest of this entry is available only to subscribers.

The average duration of pregnancy is about 280 days. Estimation of the date on which delivery should occur is based on the first day of the last menstrual period.SEE: ; SEE TABLE: ; SEE: ; SEE: ; Nursing Diagnoses AppendixAbout 7 million American women become pregnant each year, and about two thirds of these pregnancies result in live births. In 2009, there were 4,143,000 live births in the U.S.Presumptive and probable signs are those commonly associated with pregnancy but may be due to other causes, such as oral contraceptive therapy. include amenorrhea, nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness, urinary frequency, fatigue, chloasma, vaginal hyperemia (Chadwick sign), and “quickening.” include increased abdominal girth, palpable fetal outline, softening of the lower uterine segment (Hegar sign), softening of the cervix (Goodell sign), and immunodiagnostic pregnancy tests. of pregnancy are auscultation of fetal heart sounds, fetal movements felt by the examiner, and an identifiable embryonic outline on ultrasound.The pregnant woman experiences many physiological alterations related to the increased levels of estrogen and progesterone and to the demands of the growing fetus; every system in the woman's body responds to these changes. Alterations in uterine size, shape, and consistency include an increase in uterine muscle mass over the months of pregnancy. In response to elevated estrogen and progesterone levels, the cervix and lower uterine segment soften. A thick mucous plug fills the cervical canal. Vaginal secretions increase, and vaginal pH is more acidic (pH = 3.5 to 6.0). Change in vaginal pH discourages the survival and multiplication of bacteria; however, it also encourages infection by . The vagina elongates as the uterus rises in the pelvis; the mucosa thickens, with increases in secretions, vascularity, and elasticity.SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: The breasts become enlarged, tender, and more nodular. The areolae darken; the nipples become more sensitive and erectile; and Montgomery's tubercles enlarge. Colostrum may leak out during the last trimester, as the breasts prepare for lactation. The size and activity of the thyroid gland increase markedly. Levels of thyroid-binding globulin and triiodothyronine rise; levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone drop slightly. These changes allow the pregnant woman to meet the endocrine needs imposed by the developing fetus, and other body changes that occur during pregnancy. Pituitary activity increases; prolactin levels increase ensuring lactation; placental hormones prevent ovulation and encourage development of the corpus luteum. Parathyroid activity decreases during the first trimester, then increases throughout the pregnancy to meet the increasing calcium demands of the fetus. Insulin resistance increases; this poses a risk, for some women, of glucose intolerance or gestational diabetes mellitus. Circulating blood volume increases progressively throughout pregnancy, peaking in the middle of the third trimester. Although the red blood cell count rises by about 30%, a 50% increase in blood volume creates dilutional anemia. The lower relative hematocrit decreases the viscosity of the blood. However, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g is usually due to iron deficiency. Rising levels of clotting factors VII, VIII, IX, X, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor increase coagulability. The pulse rate increases, along with cardiac stroke volume. Peripheral vascular resistance drops. Mid-trimester blood pressure may be slightly lower than normal but remains essentially unchanged. Softening and increased mobility of the pelvic articulations is reflected in the waddling gait of pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, the woman's center of gravity shifts, and the lumbar curve increases to compensate for the growing anterior weight of the gravid uterus. Problems with dental caries may become more prominent during pregnancy but can be prevented with oral rinses (such as chlorhexidine) and regular brushing and flossing. The effects of progesterone on smooth muscle include a decreased airway resistance, which enables the woman to meet her increased needs for oxygen by permitting a 30% to 40% increase in tidal volume and a 15% to 20% rise in oxygen consumption. The effects of estrogen include edema and congestion of the nasal mucosa, reflected in nosebleeds and nasal stuffiness. Nausea and vomiting are the most common complaints during the first trimester. Progesterone-related diminished motility contributes to common complaints of heartburn and constipation. Hemorrhoids are common, caused by increased pressure in the lower pelvis and constipation. Alterations in T helper cell dominance produce immunological tolerance for the fetus and the placenta, both of which contain antigens that are alien to the mother. During pregnancy, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus tend to become less active. Pigmentation changes in pregnancy include chloasma (the mask of pregnancy), areolar darkening, and linea nigra (a pigmented line that vertically bisects the abdomen). They reflect estrogen-related stimulation of skin melanocytes. Striae gravidarum, stretch marks, may appear in the skin of the abdomen, breasts, and thighs. By the middle of the first trimester, the glomerular filtration rate has risen by about 50%; in compensation, tubular reabsorption also increases. Although urinary frequency is common in the first and last trimesters, bladder capacity actually increases; however, pressure from the growing uterus reduces the volume required to stimulate voiding. During the second trimester, the uterus rises out of the pelvis, becoming an abdominal organ and relieving bladder compression until late in the third trimester. In average-sized women, the expected first-trimester weight gain is 2 to 5 lb. Total weight gain and the pattern by which it increases should be monitored to enable early signs of pregnancy-related problems common to the particular point in gestation. The Institute of Medicine recommends the following weight gains during singleton pregnancies: a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index less than 19.8 should gain 25 to 39 lb (11.4 to 17.7 kg); a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index from 19.8 to 26 should gain 25 to 34 lb (11.4 to 15.5 kg); and a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index from 26 to 29 should gain 15 to 24 lb (6.8 to 10.9 kg). The recommended weight gains during pregnancy are different for multiple gestations, e.g., a woman carrying triplets should gain about 50 lb (22.7 kg) during her pregnancy.A pregnancy test, either urine or blood sample is taken, determines whether a woman is pregnant. Markers that indicate pregnancy, e.g., human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), are found in the blood and urine.An essential component to anticipatory guidance and patient teaching is to encourage the woman's active participation in her own health maintenance and pregnancy progress. Health care providers describe to pregnant women common complaints related to normal physiological changes of pregnancy and suggest actions to minimize discomfort. Hormone-related delayed gastric emptying, cardiac sphincter relaxation, and stomach displacement by the growing uterus contribute to reflux. The use of low-sodium or combination aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide preparations is recommended for symptomatic relief. For severe, unresponsive heartburn, over-the-counter H2-recedptor antagonists, such as ranitidine (Zantac) or famotidine (Pepcid), may be recommended. The woman should increase fiber and fluid intake. She also may use stool softeners. The woman may relieve the so-called charley horse that occurs during sleep by dorsiflexing the foot of the affected leg. A calcium-phosphorus imbalance may contribute to increased frequency of this problem, although the causes are not clear. The woman can increase calcium intake by drinking the recommended daily quart of milk or by drinking a pint of milk daily and taking a calcium supplement with vitamin D. Growing anterior mass, shift in center of gravity, and increased lumbar curve contribute to backaches. To relieve discomfort, the pregnant woman should wear well-fitting, low-heeled shoes and perform exercises that increase abdominal muscle tone. Pedal edema is a common third-trimester complaint related to decreased venous return from the extremities. The woman is advised to rest frequently and to elevate her feet. She should report promptly any edema of the face, hands, or sacral area to facilitate early diagnosis and management of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Decreased venous return from the extremities and compression of vascular structures by the growing uterus aggravate any weakness in the vascular walls and valves. Varicosities often occur in the legs, vulva, and pelvis. The woman should avoid tight clothing and prolonged standing. Other preventive and therapeutic measures include wearing support stockings, resting in left Sim position, and elevating the lower limbs during sleep. Temporary symptomatic relief may be obtained by Sitz baths and analgesic ointments. The woman also should be instructed in how to reinsert the hemorrhoid with a well-lubricated finger, holding it in place for 1 to 2 min before releasing the pressure. A normal increase in vaginal discharge occurs during pregnancy. Common perineal hygiene usually is effective as a comfort measure; douching is contraindicated during pregnancy. The woman should contact her primary caregiver promptly if profuse, malodorous, or blood-tinged discharge occurs. Shortness of breath occurs as the growing uterus presses on the woman's diaphragm. Elevation of the head and shoulders may provide some relief. The dyspnea disappears when lightening occurs. The normal stretching of the skin may generate itching on the breasts, abdomen, and vulva. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy is the most common benign dermatosis of pregnancy. Occurring in the third trimester, it usually resolves spontaneously after delivery. If severe, topical emollients, steroids, and antihistamines may provide some relief. Use of an emollient lotion may be suggested; the patient is instructed to inform her primary caregiver if vulvovaginal itching occurs in conjunction with an increase or alteration in vaginal discharge.A woman's nutritional status before and during pregnancy is an important factor that affects both her health and that of her unborn child. Nutritional assessment is an essential part of antepartal care. In addition, the presence of preexisting and coexisting disorders, such as anemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and phenylketonuria, may affect dietary recommendations. Substance abuse increases the risk of inadequate nutrition, low maternal weight gain, low-birth-weight infants, and perinatal mortality.Dietary recommendations emphasize a high-quality, well-balanced diet. Increased amounts of essential nutrients, i.e., protein, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium, B vitamins, vitamin C, folate, and iron, are necessary to meet nutritional needs of both mother and fetus. Most nutritional and metabolic needs can be met by eating a balanced daily diet containing approx. 35 kcal for each kilogram of optimal body weight plus an additional 300 kcal/day during the second and third trimesters. Because it is difficult to meet all the daily dietary recommendations, vitamin and iron supplements are recommended. Preparing for travel during pregnancy will depend upon the number of weeks' gestation, the duration of the travel, and the method, i.e., auto, boat, bus, train, airplane.Safety belts, preferably the combined lap and shoulder type, should be worn with the lap portion below the pregnant abdomen not across it. If nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a factor, travel by sea isn't advisable. If anti-motion-sickness medication is used, it should be one approved for use during pregnancy (or antinausea wrist bands may be used). Travel during the last part of pregnancy is not advised unless obstetrical care is available at the destination(s). It is important to carry a copy of current medical records when traveling. Travel abroad should be discussed with the obstetrician so that appropriate immunizations can be given. For travel in an area known to be endemic for malaria, certain drugs will be needed for prophylaxis.Live virus immunization should not be administered during pregnancy.

Additional testing may include determining HIV status and hepatitis immunity. Ultrasound may be used to determine age, rate of growth, position, some birth defects, and fetal sex. Chorionic villus sampling may be done early in pregnancy if the family history indicates potential for genetic diseases. Second trimester amniocentesis may be used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders, and fetal sex. In late pregnancy, nonstress tests, contraction stress tests, and fetal biophysical profiles may be done; amniocentesis may be done to evaluate fetal lung maturity.

If severe, topical emollients, steroids, and antihistamines may provide some relief. Use of an emollient lotion may be suggested; the patient is instructed to inform her primary caregiver if vulvovaginal itching occurs in conjunction with an increase or alteration in vaginal discharge.A woman's nutritional status before and during pregnancy is an important factor that affects both her health and that of her unborn child. Nutritional assessment is an essential part of antepartal care. In addition, the presence of preexisting and coexisting disorders, such as anemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and phenylketonuria, may affect dietary recommendations. Substance abuse increases the risk of inadequate nutrition, low maternal weight gain, low-birth-weight infants, and perinatal mortality.Dietary recommendations emphasize a high-quality, well-balanced diet. Increased amounts of essential nutrients, i.e., protein, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium, B vitamins, vitamin C, folate, and iron, are necessary to meet nutritional needs of both mother and fetus. Most nutritional and metabolic needs can be met by eating a balanced daily diet containing approx. 35 kcal for each kilogram of optimal body weight plus an additional 300 kcal/day during the second and third trimesters. Because it is difficult to meet all the daily dietary recommendations, vitamin and iron supplements are recommended. Preparing for travel during pregnancy will depend upon the number of weeks' gestation, the duration of the travel, and the method, i.e., auto, boat, bus, train, airplane.Safety belts, preferably the combined lap and shoulder type, should be worn with the lap portion below the pregnant abdomen not across it. If nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a factor, travel by sea isn't advisable. If anti-motion-sickness medication is used, it should be one approved for use during pregnancy (or antinausea wrist bands may be used). Travel during the last part of pregnancy is not advised unless obstetrical care is available at the destination(s). It is important to carry a copy of current medical records when traveling. Travel abroad should be discussed with the obstetrician so that appropriate immunizations can be given. For travel in an area known to be endemic for malaria, certain drugs will be needed for prophylaxis.Live virus immunization should not be administered during pregnancy. Healthy pregnant women who are employed in jobs that present no more risk than those in daily life are encouraged to continue working if they desire until shortly before delivery. If the pregnancy is progressing normally, exercise should be continued. The amount and type of exercise is an individual matter. A woman who has exercised regularly before her pregnancy should experience no difficulty with continuing; however, a previously sedentary woman should not attempt to institute a vigorous exercise program such as long-distance running or jogging during her pregnancy. No matter what the type of exercise, it is important to remember that, with the progress of pregnancy, the center of gravity will change and probably prevent participation at the same level and skill as before pregnancy. Sports to avoid include water skiing, horseback riding, and scuba diving. In horseback riding, in addition to the possibility of falling from the horse, the repeated bouncing may lead to bruising of the perianal area. Scuba diving may lead to decompression sickness and bends and to intravascular air embolism in the fetus. Women who breast-feed their children should continue exercising if they maintain hydration and adequate breast support. Women who are experiencing normally progressing pregnancies need not avoid intercourse. Pregnant women should refrain from coitus if they have a history of preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes and if they are bleeding or have ruptured membranes. Common tests include blood tests for nutritional or sickle cell anemia, blood type and Rh factor, rubella titers, syphilis, and serum alpha-fetoprotein for the presence of neural tube defects such as spina bifida. Additional testing may include determining HIV status and hepatitis immunity. Ultrasound may be used to determine age, rate of growth, position, some birth defects, and fetal sex. Chorionic villus sampling may be done early in pregnancy if the family history indicates potential for genetic diseases. Second trimester amniocentesis may be used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders, and fetal sex. In late pregnancy, nonstress tests, contraction stress tests, and fetal biophysical profiles may be done; amniocentesis may be done to evaluate fetal lung maturity. SEE TABLE: Influenza vaccination is recommended during pregnancy Although pregnancy among teenagers is decreasing in the U.S., approx. 7% of all American teenage girls still become pregnant in any given year, one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in developed countries. Sociocultural factors are believed to contribute to the high incidence of pregnancies among this population. Demographic data indicate that teenage pregnancy is more likely to be associated with being single, having low socioeconomic status, and lacking social support systems. Pregnant teenagers are believed to be at high risk for some complications of pregnancy; if, however, they seek prenatal care early and consistently cooperate with recommendations, the risk is comparable to that for other age groups. Clinical data identify a common pattern of late entry to the prenatal care system, failure to return for scheduled appointments, and noncompliance with medical and nursing recommendations. As a result of these behaviors, adolescents are at higher risk for pregnancy-related complications, such as iron-deficiency anemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm labor and delivery, low birthweight newborns, and cephalopelvic disproportion. Other health problems seen more commonly in pregnant adolescents include sexually transmitted diseases and substance abuse.SEE: ; Nursing Diagnoses Appendix A growing number of women are experiencing their first pregnancies after age 35. The incidence of fetal demise among this population is 6:1000 births, double the rate for women under 35. Many factors may contribute to the increased risk, including preexisting and coexisting conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and uterine fibroids. Mature women are identified as being at higher risk for spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, placenta previa, gestational diabetes, cesarean birth, and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. Multiple-gestation secondary assisted reproduction also may be a factor in fetal loss. Very rarely, postmenopausal women have become pregnant through embryo donation and have successfully carried the pregnancy to term delivery. Prior to undergoing this procedure, the women had been undergoing hormone replacement therapy. Previously, it had been assumed that the postmenopausal uterus would not be capable of supporting the growth and development of an embryo. Pregnancies in older women are considered high risk for reasons similar to those related to mature pregnancy. Late in the third trimester, the woman may be instructed to keep a fetal activity record and undergo regularly scheduled nonstress tests. • Assessment of pregnant women for alcohol misuse and tobacco use • Chlamydia and gonorrhea (antigen or culture) tests There's more to see -- the rest of this entry is available only to subscribers.

The average duration of pregnancy is about 280 days. Estimation of the date on which delivery should occur is based on the first day of the last menstrual period.SEE: ; SEE TABLE: ; SEE: ; SEE: ; Nursing Diagnoses AppendixAbout 7 million American women become pregnant each year, and about two thirds of these pregnancies result in live births. In 2009, there were 4,143,000 live births in the U.S.Presumptive and probable signs are those commonly associated with pregnancy but may be due to other causes, such as oral contraceptive therapy. include amenorrhea, nausea and vomiting, breast tenderness, urinary frequency, fatigue, chloasma, vaginal hyperemia (Chadwick sign), and “quickening.” include increased abdominal girth, palpable fetal outline, softening of the lower uterine segment (Hegar sign), softening of the cervix (Goodell sign), and immunodiagnostic pregnancy tests. of pregnancy are auscultation of fetal heart sounds, fetal movements felt by the examiner, and an identifiable embryonic outline on ultrasound.The pregnant woman experiences many physiological alterations related to the increased levels of estrogen and progesterone and to the demands of the growing fetus; every system in the woman's body responds to these changes. Alterations in uterine size, shape, and consistency include an increase in uterine muscle mass over the months of pregnancy. In response to elevated estrogen and progesterone levels, the cervix and lower uterine segment soften. A thick mucous plug fills the cervical canal. Vaginal secretions increase, and vaginal pH is more acidic (pH = 3.5 to 6.0). Change in vaginal pH discourages the survival and multiplication of bacteria; however, it also encourages infection by . The vagina elongates as the uterus rises in the pelvis; the mucosa thickens, with increases in secretions, vascularity, and elasticity.SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: The breasts become enlarged, tender, and more nodular. The areolae darken; the nipples become more sensitive and erectile; and Montgomery's tubercles enlarge. Colostrum may leak out during the last trimester, as the breasts prepare for lactation. The size and activity of the thyroid gland increase markedly. Levels of thyroid-binding globulin and triiodothyronine rise; levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone drop slightly. These changes allow the pregnant woman to meet the endocrine needs imposed by the developing fetus, and other body changes that occur during pregnancy. Pituitary activity increases; prolactin levels increase ensuring lactation; placental hormones prevent ovulation and encourage development of the corpus luteum. Parathyroid activity decreases during the first trimester, then increases throughout the pregnancy to meet the increasing calcium demands of the fetus. Insulin resistance increases; this poses a risk, for some women, of glucose intolerance or gestational diabetes mellitus. Circulating blood volume increases progressively throughout pregnancy, peaking in the middle of the third trimester. Although the red blood cell count rises by about 30%, a 50% increase in blood volume creates dilutional anemia. The lower relative hematocrit decreases the viscosity of the blood. However, a hemoglobin concentration of less than 11 g is usually due to iron deficiency. Rising levels of clotting factors VII, VIII, IX, X, fibrinogen, and von Willebrand factor increase coagulability. The pulse rate increases, along with cardiac stroke volume. Peripheral vascular resistance drops. Mid-trimester blood pressure may be slightly lower than normal but remains essentially unchanged. Softening and increased mobility of the pelvic articulations is reflected in the waddling gait of pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, the woman's center of gravity shifts, and the lumbar curve increases to compensate for the growing anterior weight of the gravid uterus. Problems with dental caries may become more prominent during pregnancy but can be prevented with oral rinses (such as chlorhexidine) and regular brushing and flossing. The effects of progesterone on smooth muscle include a decreased airway resistance, which enables the woman to meet her increased needs for oxygen by permitting a 30% to 40% increase in tidal volume and a 15% to 20% rise in oxygen consumption. The effects of estrogen include edema and congestion of the nasal mucosa, reflected in nosebleeds and nasal stuffiness. Nausea and vomiting are the most common complaints during the first trimester. Progesterone-related diminished motility contributes to common complaints of heartburn and constipation. are common, caused by increased pressure in the lower pelvis and constipation. Alterations in T helper cell dominance produce immunological tolerance for the fetus and the placenta, both of which contain antigens that are alien to the mother. During pregnancy, autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus tend to become less active. Pigmentation changes in pregnancy include chloasma (the mask of pregnancy), areolar darkening, and linea nigra (a pigmented line that vertically bisects the abdomen). They reflect estrogen-related stimulation of skin melanocytes. Striae gravidarum, stretch marks, may appear in the skin of the abdomen, breasts, and thighs. By the middle of the first trimester, the glomerular filtration rate has risen by about 50%; in compensation, tubular reabsorption also increases. Although urinary frequency is common in the first and last trimesters, bladder capacity actually increases; however, pressure from the growing uterus reduces the volume required to stimulate voiding. During the second trimester, the uterus rises out of the pelvis, becoming an abdominal organ and relieving bladder compression until late in the third trimester. In average-sized women, the expected first-trimester weight gain is 2 to 5 lb. Total weight gain and the pattern by which it increases should be monitored to enable early signs of pregnancy-related problems common to the particular point in gestation. The Institute of Medicine recommends the following weight gains during singleton pregnancies: a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index less than 19.8 should gain 25 to 39 lb (11.4 to 17.7 kg); a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index from 19.8 to 26 should gain 25 to 34 lb (11.4 to 15.5 kg); and a woman with a prepregnancy body mass index from 26 to 29 should gain 15 to 24 lb (6.8 to 10.9 kg). The recommended weight gains during pregnancy are different for multiple gestations, e.g., a woman carrying triplets should gain about 50 lb (22.7 kg) during her pregnancy.A pregnancy test, either urine or blood sample is taken, determines whether a woman is pregnant. Markers that indicate pregnancy, e.g., human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), are found in the blood and urine.An essential component to anticipatory guidance and patient teaching is to encourage the woman's active participation in her own health maintenance and pregnancy progress. Health care providers describe to pregnant women common complaints related to normal physiological changes of pregnancy and suggest actions to minimize discomfort. Hormone-related delayed gastric emptying, cardiac sphincter relaxation, and stomach displacement by the growing uterus contribute to reflux. The use of low-sodium or combination aluminum hydroxide/magnesium hydroxide preparations is recommended for symptomatic relief. For severe, unresponsive heartburn, over-the-counter H2-recedptor antagonists, such as ranitidine (Zantac) or famotidine (Pepcid), may be recommended. The woman should increase fiber and fluid intake. She also may use stool softeners. The woman may relieve the so-called charley horse that occurs during sleep by dorsiflexing the foot of the affected leg. A calcium-phosphorus imbalance may contribute to increased frequency of this problem, although the causes are not clear. The woman can increase calcium intake by drinking the recommended daily quart of milk or by drinking a pint of milk daily and taking a calcium supplement with vitamin D. Growing anterior mass, shift in center of gravity, and increased lumbar curve contribute to backaches. To relieve discomfort, the pregnant woman should wear well-fitting, low-heeled shoes and perform exercises that increase abdominal muscle tone. Pedal edema is a common third-trimester complaint related to decreased venous return from the extremities. The woman is advised to rest frequently and to elevate her feet. She should report promptly any edema of the face, hands, or sacral area to facilitate early diagnosis and management of pregnancy-induced hypertension. Decreased venous return from the extremities and compression of vascular structures by the growing uterus aggravate any weakness in the vascular walls and valves. Varicosities often occur in the legs, vulva, and pelvis. The woman should avoid tight clothing and prolonged standing. Other preventive and therapeutic measures include wearing support stockings, resting in left Sim position, and elevating the lower limbs during sleep. Temporary symptomatic relief may be obtained by Sitz baths and analgesic ointments. The woman also should be instructed in how to reinsert the hemorrhoid with a well-lubricated finger, holding it in place for 1 to 2 min before releasing the pressure. A normal increase in vaginal discharge occurs during pregnancy. Common perineal hygiene usually is effective as a comfort measure; douching is contraindicated during pregnancy. The woman should contact her primary caregiver promptly if profuse, malodorous, or blood-tinged discharge occurs. Shortness of breath occurs as the growing uterus presses on the woman's diaphragm. Elevation of the head and shoulders may provide some relief. The dyspnea disappears when lightening occurs. The normal stretching of the skin may generate itching on the breasts, abdomen, and vulva. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy is the most common benign dermatosis of pregnancy. Occurring in the third trimester, it usually resolves spontaneously after delivery. If severe, topical emollients, steroids, and antihistamines may provide some relief. Use of an emollient lotion may be suggested; the patient is instructed to inform her primary caregiver if vulvovaginal itching occurs in conjunction with an increase or alteration in vaginal discharge.A woman's nutritional status before and during pregnancy is an important factor that affects both her health and that of her unborn child. Nutritional assessment is an essential part of antepartal care. In addition, the presence of preexisting and coexisting disorders, such as anemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and phenylketonuria, may affect dietary recommendations. Substance abuse increases the risk of inadequate nutrition, low maternal weight gain, low-birth-weight infants, and perinatal mortality.Dietary recommendations emphasize a high-quality, well-balanced diet. Increased amounts of essential nutrients, i.e., protein, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium, B vitamins, vitamin C, folate, and iron, are necessary to meet nutritional needs of both mother and fetus.

In addition, the presence of preexisting and coexisting disorders, such as anemia, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease, and phenylketonuria, may affect dietary recommendations. Substance abuse increases the risk of inadequate nutrition, low maternal weight gain, low-birth-weight infants, and perinatal mortality.Dietary recommendations emphasize a high-quality, well-balanced diet. Increased amounts of essential nutrients, i.e., protein, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and selenium, B vitamins, vitamin C, folate, and iron, are necessary to meet nutritional needs of both mother and fetus. Most nutritional and metabolic needs can be met by eating a balanced daily diet containing approx. 35 kcal for each kilogram of optimal body weight plus an additional 300 kcal/day during the second and third trimesters. Because it is difficult to meet all the daily dietary recommendations, vitamin and iron supplements are recommended. Preparing for travel during pregnancy will depend upon the number of weeks' gestation, the duration of the travel, and the method, i.e., auto, boat, bus, train, airplane.Safety belts, preferably the combined lap and shoulder type, should be worn with the lap portion below the pregnant abdomen not across it. If nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is a factor, travel by sea isn't advisable. If anti-motion-sickness medication is used, it should be one approved for use during pregnancy (or antinausea wrist bands may be used). Travel during the last part of pregnancy is not advised unless obstetrical care is available at the destination(s). It is important to carry a copy of current medical records when traveling. Travel abroad should be discussed with the obstetrician so that appropriate immunizations can be given. For travel in an area known to be endemic for malaria, certain drugs will be needed for prophylaxis.Live virus immunization should not be administered during pregnancy. Healthy pregnant women who are employed in jobs that present no more risk than those in daily life are encouraged to continue working if they desire until shortly before delivery. If the pregnancy is progressing normally, exercise should be continued. The amount and type of exercise is an individual matter. A woman who has exercised regularly before her pregnancy should experience no difficulty with continuing; however, a previously sedentary woman should not attempt to institute a vigorous exercise program such as long-distance running or jogging during her pregnancy. No matter what the type of exercise, it is important to remember that, with the progress of pregnancy, the center of gravity will change and probably prevent participation at the same level and skill as before pregnancy. Sports to avoid include water skiing, horseback riding, and scuba diving. In horseback riding, in addition to the possibility of falling from the horse, the repeated bouncing may lead to bruising of the perianal area. Scuba diving may lead to decompression sickness and bends and to intravascular air embolism in the fetus. Women who breast-feed their children should continue exercising if they maintain hydration and adequate breast support. Women who are experiencing normally progressing pregnancies need not avoid intercourse. Pregnant women should refrain from coitus if they have a history of preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes and if they are bleeding or have ruptured membranes. Common tests include blood tests for nutritional or sickle cell anemia, blood type and Rh factor, rubella titers, syphilis, and serum alpha-fetoprotein for the presence of neural tube defects such as spina bifida. Additional testing may include determining HIV status and hepatitis immunity. Ultrasound may be used to determine age, rate of growth, position, some birth defects, and fetal sex. Chorionic villus sampling may be done early in pregnancy if the family history indicates potential for genetic diseases. Second trimester amniocentesis may be used to detect chromosomal abnormalities, genetic disorders, and fetal sex. In late pregnancy, nonstress tests, contraction stress tests, and fetal biophysical profiles may be done; amniocentesis may be done to evaluate fetal lung maturity. SEE TABLE: Influenza vaccination is recommended during pregnancy Although pregnancy among teenagers is decreasing in the U.S., approx. 7% of all American teenage girls still become pregnant in any given year, one of the highest rates of teenage pregnancy in developed countries. Sociocultural factors are believed to contribute to the high incidence of pregnancies among this population. Demographic data indicate that teenage pregnancy is more likely to be associated with being single, having low socioeconomic status, and lacking social support systems. Pregnant teenagers are believed to be at high risk for some complications of pregnancy; if, however, they seek prenatal care early and consistently cooperate with recommendations, the risk is comparable to that for other age groups. Clinical data identify a common pattern of late entry to the prenatal care system, failure to return for scheduled appointments, and noncompliance with medical and nursing recommendations. As a result of these behaviors, adolescents are at higher risk for pregnancy-related complications, such as iron-deficiency anemia, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preterm labor and delivery, low birthweight newborns, and cephalopelvic disproportion. Other health problems seen more commonly in pregnant adolescents include sexually transmitted diseases and substance abuse.SEE: ; Nursing Diagnoses Appendix A growing number of women are experiencing their first pregnancies after age 35. The incidence of fetal demise among this population is 6:1000 births, double the rate for women under 35. Many factors may contribute to the increased risk, including preexisting and coexisting conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and uterine fibroids. Mature women are identified as being at higher risk for spontaneous abortion, preeclampsia, abruptio placentae, placenta previa, gestational diabetes, cesarean birth, and chromosomal abnormalities such as Down syndrome. Multiple-gestation secondary assisted reproduction also may be a factor in fetal loss. Very rarely, postmenopausal women have become pregnant through embryo donation and have successfully carried the pregnancy to term delivery. Prior to undergoing this procedure, the women had been undergoing hormone replacement therapy. Previously, it had been assumed that the postmenopausal uterus would not be capable of supporting the growth and development of an embryo. Pregnancies in older women are considered high risk for reasons similar to those related to mature pregnancy. Late in the third trimester, the woman may be instructed to keep a fetal activity record and undergo regularly scheduled nonstress tests. • Assessment of pregnant women for alcohol misuse and tobacco use • Chlamydia and gonorrhea (antigen or culture) tests There's more to see -- the rest of this entry is available only to subscribers.

Clinical outcomes after assisted reproductive technology in twin pregnancies: chorionicity-based comparison Clinical outcomes after assisted reproductive technology in twin pregnancies: chorionicity-based comparison , Article number:  () The chorionicity–based evaluation of the perinatal risk in twin pregnancies after assisted reproductive technology (ART) is lacking. A retrospective review was performed of all twin pregnancies monitored prenatally and delivered at our hospital between 2010 and 2014. Chorionicity was diagnosed by ultrasound examination at first trimester and confirmed by postnatal pathology. Pregnancy and perinatal outcomes were prospectively recorded. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated in a logistic regression model. A total of 1153 twin pregnancies were analyzed. The occurrence of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) was 3 times as frequent in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies after ART as in those spontaneous counterparts (aOR 3.0; 95%CI 1.1–3.2). The prevalence of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancies (ICP) was significantly higher in dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancies following ART compared to spontaneous DCDA pregnancies (aOR 3.3; 95%CI 1.3–5.6). Perinatal outcomes did not differ between two conception methods, either in MCDA or DCDA twin pregnancies. Based on differentiation of chorionicity, ART is associated with the increased risk of PPROM in MCDA twin pregnancies and with a higher rate of ICP in DCDA twin gestations. ART does not increase adversity of perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is currently the preferred management for various types of infertility, concomitant with increased rate of twin pregnancies. Recently, the related complication rates among ART versus spontaneous pregnancies have been explored. An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated that twins born from ART-conceived pregnancies are at a higher risk of perinatal morbidity and mortality, such as birth defects and low birth weight, compared with twins from pregnancies conceived naturally. The evidence on the impact of ART on maternal morbidities in twin pregnancies clarified by chorionicity is lacking. What exists is conflicting and mixed, with some studies showing a higher risk of such morbidities as gestational hypertension and gestational diabetes among ART twin pregnancies and others showing no impact of ART. In addition, little has been reported on the impact of ART on maternal outcomes in monochorionic diamniotic (MCDA) twin pregnancies. This lack of evidence may be due to the relative paucity of MCDA twin pregnancies after ART treatment. Given the difference in perinatal risk between MCDA and dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancies, chorionicity-based analysis is thus necessary to assess the maternal risk in twin pregnancies resulting from assisted conception. The purpose of this study is to investigate selected clinical outcomes among ART–conceived twin pregnancies compared to spontaneously conceived twin pregnancies and to determine whether these outcomes are further affected by chorionicity. A total of 1228 twin pregnancies were monitored prenatally and delivered at our hospital during the study period. Structural anomalies were detected in 75 twin pregnancies and excluded from this study. The remaining 1153 twin pregnancies were analyzed. A flow chart illustrates the inclusion criteria of this study (). Among MCDA twin pregnancies, the mean maternal age and body mass index were significantly higher in twin pregnancies following ART compared to spontaneously conceived twin pregnancies (). Among DCDA twin pregnancies, mean maternal age and the proportion of nullipara were significantly higher in twin pregnancies following ART compared to spontaneously conceived twin pregnancies. These maternal characteristics are selected as the independent variables in following multiple regression analysis due to their significant difference between compared subgroups and close association with pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. In addition, the interactions between independent variables was analyzed and displayed in . There was a higher risk of ICP among DCDA twins following ART compared to DCDA twins with spontaneous conceptions (aOR 3.3, 95% CI 1.3–5.6) and a higher risk of PPROM among MCDA twins following ART compared to MCDA twins with spontaneous conceptions (aOR 3.0, 95% CI 1.1–3.2). In the subgroup of MCDA twin pregnancies, the frequency of gestational hypertension (aOR 4.3, 95% CI .8–24.4) and placenta previa (aOR 4.5, 95% CI .8–24.6) tended to be higher in MCDA twins following ART compared to the counterparts conceived spontaneously, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Chorionicity–based comparisons of maternal complications between twin pregnancies conceived spontaneously and following ART were displayed in . We further compared the rate of maternal complications between the subgroups of MCDA and DCDA twin pregnancies with control of conception models (). In the subgroup of twin pregnancies conceived spontaneously, the risk of maternal composite outcomes in MCDA twins was significantly increased compared to DCDA twins, 38.9% versus 52.7%, respectively (aOR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2–2.4). In the subgroup of twin pregnancies conceived following ART, the occurrence of maternal complications was comparable between MCDA and DCDA twins. The perinatal outcomes did not significantly differ between MCDA twins from pregnancies conceived spontaneously or through ART. Similarly, no significant difference were found in perinatal outcomes between DCDA twins of spontaneous or ART conception. This data is summarized in . This study also investigated the impact of chorionicity on perinatal outcome in the subgroups of twin pregnancies conceived spontaneously or after ART (). In both subgroups of twin pregnancies conceived spontaneously or after ART, the adversity of perinatal outcomes was significantly higher in MCDA twins compared to DCDA twins. The comparison of perinatal outcomes between MCDA and DCDA twins after excluding twin pregnancies with MCDA–specific complications is shown in . Delivery prior to 28 weeks was 7.7 to 14.4 times more likely to occur in MCDA twins compared to DCDA twins. The prevalence of MCDA–specific perinatal complications by method of conception is displayed in . ART did not increase the risks of specific complications in MCDA twins, 24% (7/29) versus 39% (168/427), respectively (P = 0.11). The present study demonstrates that ART is significantly associated with higher prevalence of PPROM in MCDA twin pregnancies following ART compared to MCDA twins with spontaneous conceptions and ICP in DCDA twin pregnancies following ART compared to DCDA twins with spontaneous conceptions. We also found ART does not increase perinatal morbidity outcomes in twin pregnancies of both types of chorionicity. MCDA twins remained at higher risks of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes compared to DCDA twins after TTTS, sIUGR, TAPS and TRAP cases were excluded, but not related to mode of conception. Several studies have previously reported that ART-conceived pregnancies are independently associated with maternal complications. However, data specific to ART conceived twin pregnancies are limited and contradictory, especially in MCDA twin pregnancies after ART treatment. This may be explained by the rarity of MCDA twin pregnancies (2% of twin pregnancies) after ART treatment. Importantly, the maternal complications in twin pregnancies from ART have not been analyzed with respect to chorionicity. MCDA twin pregnancies are at an increased risk of pregnancy-related complications compared to those with DCDA twins. Obstetric outcomes of MCDA and DCDA twin pregnancies after ART vs spontaneous conception were thus respectively compared in the present study. Consistent with previous studies, no significant difference in maternal outcomes is detected among DCDA twin gestations following ART compared to their corresponding spontaneous counterparts with exception of ICP the rate of which is significantly higher in DCDA pregnancies after ART in this study. However, the occurrence of maternal complications generally tends to be higher in MCDA pregnancies after ART compared to spontaneous cases. Even further, PPROM occurs in MCDA twin pregnancies following ART more than twice as frequently as natural MCDA twin pregnancies. Notably, similar to a recent report, increased maternal age and heavier BMI are characterized in the cohort of MCDA twin pregnancies after ART in the present study, which may partially explain the higher prevalence of maternal complications. Residual confounding due to the underlying pathological conditions leading to infertility might at least be part of the explanation for no significance. Unfortunately, a small sample size of 29 MCDA pregnancies after ART was included in this study, which may also preclude our findings reaching significance. A large, multicenter study may thus be required to investigate the ART–associated maternal risk, especially in MCDA twin pregnancies after ART. Several studies shows the presence of two placental masses in DCDA twin pregnancies is associated with increased risk of maternal complications such as preeclampsia and GDM. This study also demonstrates an increased risk of preeclampsia, PPH and PPROM in DCDA twin pregnancies in the subgroup of twin pregnancies conceived spontaneously. However, this association was not detected in subgroup of twin pregnancies conceived following ART. Again, the rarity of MCDA twin pregnancies after ART limits the investigation on association between maternal risk and chorionicity in the subgroup of twin pregnancies conceived following ART in this study. In our study, perinatal outcomes among MCDA twins after ART treatment were similar to those conceived spontaneously. This is in contrast to the study from Vandermeulen , who reported that ART resulted in an excess of adversity in MCDA twins. It is well recognized that perinatal outcomes in MCDA twins are primarily dependent on the presence or absence of the specific complications, such as TTTS. Unfortunately, MCDA–specific complications were not differentiated from other outcomes in the cohort from Vandermeulen , preventing us from further comparison. Similarly, we also found ART did not increase the risk of perinatal outcomes in DCDA twins. Our findings are in accordance with several previous reports, but not all. The disparities among these studies may be attributable to the different etiology of infertility, methods of ART, study design and sample size. A number of studies report that MCDA twins have a higher perinatal risk than DCDA twins due to the ubiquitous vascular anastomoses in monochorionic placentas and associated complications. In the same line, this study showed that the perinatal risk in MCDA twins was significantly higher compared to DCDA twins, whether in the subgroup of spontaneous conception or ART. The present study further found MCDA twins are still at an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes compared to DCDA twins after excluding cases with anastomoses-associated complications such as TTTS, TAPS, TRAP and sIUGR of type II or III. Our findings are in agreement with a previous study from Leduc . However, Carter and Lewi reported a comparable perinatal outcome between MCDA and DCDA twins with excluding specific complications for MCDA twins. This may be due to the difference in prenatal monitoring and interventions at these centers. Several limitations of this study, besides its respective nature, should be considered. One is the small number of MCDA twin pregnancies after ART treatment prevents any firm conclusion, though a larger twin cohort was analyzed in this study compared to previous literature. This may be putative for a single–center study given the paucity of MCDA twin pregnancies (2%) following ART. Another limitation is that our findings may be confounded by the heterogeneity of infertility treated by ART. For instance, it is reported that the clinical expression after ART to treat blocked tubes in patients with younger maternal age and lower BMI is more favorable than that in patients developing ART due to other complications such as polycystic ovary syndrome. However, it may be an arduous task to control for each type of infertility in a single–center study, even given the rarity of MCDA twin pregnancies after ART. Again, a well–controlled multicenter study is needed to study the impact of ART on clinical outcomes. Finally, iatrogenic damage to ova could occur during ART procedure. However, the extent to which ART procedure–related damage contributes to the adversity of perinatal outcomes could not be assessed in the present study. In conclusion, based on the differentiation of chorionicity, the present study shows that IVF and/or ICSI is associated with a significantly increased the risk of PPROM in MCDA twin pregnancies and ICP in DCDA twin pregnancies. Perinatal outcomes in twin pregnancies after IVF and/or ICSI are similar to those conceived naturally. This was a retrospective review of all twin pregnancies undergoing serial ultrasound examinations and delivering at the Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital from January 2010 to December 2014. This study was approved by the Shanghai First Maternity and Infant Hospital Scientific and Ethics Committees (registration number: 134119a4400). Written informed consent was obtained from each patient participating in the study. This study was performed in accordance with the approved guidelines without variations. A SPSS–based database was created for the registration of cases one by one. A research nurse was appointed to manage the database routinely following a tutorial providing definition for each variable. After the design of this study, the final version of the database was scrutinized by an experienced epidemiologist. An ultrasound was performed between 7 and 14 weeks’ gestation to diagnose chorionicity. Chorionicity was confirmed by postnatal pathology. Discordance was corrected based on the pathology report. A second ultrasound for the anatomic survey was performed routinely. Twin pregnancies were excluded from this study if gross structural anomalies were detected given that those cases were managed with fetal reduction, feticide or termination of pregnancies. ART twin pregnancies were defined as those following fertilization (IVF) or IVF/intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Maternal obesity was defined as a Body Mass Index (BMI) of ≥30 kg/m at the first visiting to our center. Maternal complications were recorded and included gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancies (ICP), placental previa, placental abruption, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Gestational hypertension was defined as new onset of hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmHg) after 20 weeks of gestation without proteinuria; if proteinuria (>300 mg in 24 hours) was present, the diagnosis of preeclampsia was made. GDM was diagnosed based on the plasma glucose levels recommended by the National Diabetes Data Group in the most recent guideline from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Briefly, the plasma glucose threshold to diagnose GDM is 105 mg/dL for fasting blood test, 190 mg/dL at 1 hour after OGTT, 165 mg/dL at 2 hours after OCTT or 145 mg/dL at 3 hours after OCTT. The diagnosis of ICP was based on: 1) onset of generalized pruritus in the second or third trimester of pregnancy; 2) bile acid level >10 μmol/L; and 3) spontaneous relief within 3 weeks after delivery. Placenta previa was recorded according to the last ultrasound examination revealing the placenta covering internal os before delivery. PPROM was documented as rupture of membranes prior to 37 week’s gestation. Placental abruption was recorded if it was listed as a diagnosis on the medical record. PPH was defined as vaginal blood loss of ≥500 ml within 24 hours after delivery. Adverse perinatal outcomes were recorded and included fetal loss (≤24 weeks of gestation), perinatal mortality (fetal demise after 24 weeks of gestation or neonatal death within 28 days after birth), delivery <28 weeks, delivery <32 weeks, birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA, defined as birth weight <the 10 centile for gestational age), birth weight <1500 gm, NICU admission and birth weight discordance (BWD)>25% calculated by the following formula: ((birth weight of larger twin–birth weight of smaller twin)/birth weight of larger twin) ×100. Specific complications of MCDA twins were recorded and analyzed separately. These included twin–twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), twin anemia–polycythemia sequence (TAPS), twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) and selective intrauterine growth restriction (sIUGR). Diagnosis of TTTS was based on the Eurofetus criteria: polyhydramnios (deepest vertical pocket ≥8 cm before 20 weeks or 10 cm after 20 weeks of gestation) in the recipient sac and oligohydramnios (deepest vertical pocket ≤2 cm) in the donor sac. Staging of TTTS was according to Quintero’s system. TAPS was diagnosed according to the criteria proposed by Slaghekke : Doppler ultrasound detecting an increase in middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA-PSV) of over 1.5 multiples of the median (MoM) in one fetus that coincided with a decrease in MCA-PSV of less than 0.8 MoM in the co-twin; postnatal criteria consists of the hematology test (inter-twin Hb difference >8.0 g/dL and inter-twin reticulocyte count ratio >1.7) and placental injection showing only few small anastomoses present. TRAP is defined as the blood flow pumped from the pump twin into the perfused twin. Diagnosis and classification of sIUGR were based on the Gratacos’s system. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to examine the normality of data. Continuous data were analyzed using Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U test, where appropriate. Chi-square or Fisher’s exact test was employed to compare categorical variables. A p value of <0.05 was considered as statistical significance. A multiple logistic regression model was established to evaluate maternal complications and perinatal outcomes in relation to conception methods and chorionicity. The selection of independent variables for multiple regression model was based on the maternal characteristics which are significantly different between compared subgroups and are closely associated with pregnancy and perinatal outcomes. : Sun, L.

For patients with these infections, fluoroquinolones should be reserved for those who have no alternative treatment options. In most cases of acute sinusitis and acute bronchitis, viral rather than bacterial infections are common, and antimicrobials may not be needed. This announcement was based on an FDA safety review showing that systemic fluoroquinolone use is associated with side effects, which although uncommon can be disabling and potentially permanent, including those involving the tendons, muscles, joints, nerves, and central nervous system.

Risk factors include minor neck trauma (cervical manipulation in this patient), family history of arterial disease, and connective tissue disorders. This is the most frequent cause of stroke in patients < 45 years old. What is the treatment of choice for a carotid artery dissection? D. Sickle cell anemiaChildren with sickle cell anemia (D) who no longer have a functional spleen should receive the meningococcal vaccine. Autosplenectomy dramatically increases the risk of serious infections from encapsulated organisms including Neisseria meningitides, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Which of the following conditions should prompt administration of the meningococcal vaccine prior to the standard 11 years of age?A. Cystic fibrosisYour AnswerB. Diabetes mellitusC. Hypoplastic left heartD. Sickle cell anemia This condition begins as Tinea capitis (scalp ringworm) that undergoes a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to the causative fungus. This inflammation causes the initial erythematous, scaly plaque of Tinea capitis to become boggy with inflamed purulent nodules and plaques. Which of the following sources of fluoride has the highest risk of causing dental fluorosis?A. Community water fluoridation with 0.7 ppm fluorideB. Fluoride drops and tablets C. Fluoride gel and varnishD. Tooth brushing with 1000 ppm fluoride toothpaste What is the most common cause for syncope in a patient with a non-specific history, normal physical exam and normal EKG? A CT scan with IV contrast(An ultrasound (D) in experienced hands can be very useful in identifying an RPA, but is not yet accepted as first line overall.) ______________ is currently the imaging modality of choice for a retropharyngeal abscess (RPA), What is the most common cause of chronic retropharyngeal abscesses? SigmoidoscopyThe radiograph demonstrates a markedly dilated single loop of colon consistent with a sigmoid volvulus. Sigmoidoscopy is used to decompress and detorse the bowel. Measure Negative Inspiratory ForceThis patient is experiencing a myasthenic crisis, which is impending respiratory failure with an associated need for mechanical ventilation. An objective measure of respiratory status (i.e., negative inspiratory force [NIF] or forced vital capacity [FVC]) should be trended to evaluate the need for mechanical ventilation. A 28-year-old woman with myasthenia gravis presents with progressive shortness of breath that started several hours ago. She takes pyridostigmine every 6 hours and has not missed any doses. Yesterday she was prescribed an unknown antibiotic for sinusitis at an urgent care clinic. On exam, her vital signs are within normal limits, and she does not appear in respiratory distress. What is the next immediate step in management? -year-old girl presents to the emergency department with a one-day history of rash. The rash is erythematous, macular, blanching, and covers her trunk and extremities. It is not painful or pruritic, and there are no vesicles, bullae or mucosal lesions noted. She has bilateral lymphadenopathy in the posterior cervical chains with splenomegaly on palpation of her abdomen. The rest of her physical exam is normal. Her pediatrician started an antibiotic last week for pharyngitis but she has not improved. What is the most likely etiology of her rash? BradycardiaCushing's triad is usually a pre-terminal event seen in patients with increased intracranial pressure and cerebral herniation through the foramen magnum. It is associated with decreased level of alertness, hypertension, bradycardia, and irregular respirations. Bradycardia is the first sign and is therefore the most sensitive indicator. A seven-year-old boy is involved in a rollover motor vehicle collision. He arrives intubated by the paramedic service. On exam, you note him to be flexing both upper extremities. Which of the following is the most sensitive indicator of herniation?A) BradycardiaB) HypertensionC) HypotensionD) Irregular respiration RicketsRickets refers to deficient mineralization at the growth plate. The boy in the vignette has calcipenic rickets that is caused by calcium deficiency. This is due to insufficient intake or metabolism of vitamin D. A four-year-old boy is new to your practice and comes into the clinic with his mother for a health supervision visit. The family recently migrated from the Middle East. The mother does not have any concerns. On exam, you note height at 5th percentile, enlargement of the costochondral junction, widening of the wrist and varus deformities of the legs. X-ray shows osteopenic epiphyseal centers. Laboratory tests reveal elevated alkaline phosphatase and low serum phosphorus and calcium. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) Blount diseaseB) HypophosphatasiaC) RicketsD) Skeletal dysplasia is most common.Bullous myringitis is a direct inflammation and infection of the tympanic membrane caused by a viral or bacterial agent. Vesicles or bullae filled with blood or serosanguineous fluid on an erythematous tympanic membrane are the hallmark of bullous myringitis. Bullous myringitis was previously linked to Mycoplasma pneumoniae but it appears, based on middle ear aspirate culture results, that typical acute otitis media pathogens are the true cause. A 2-year-old boy presents with right-sided ear pain. On otoscopy, you observe the image seen above. What organism is most commonly the cause of this condition? What condition is associated with clear, fluid-filled tympanic membrane vesicles and facial nerve paralysis? Complex regional pain syndrome = chronic pain in a body region, but it most commonly affects the extremities. It is characterized by pain, swelling, skin changes, vasomotor instability, limited range of motion, and patchy bone demineralization. It frequently occurs after a soft tissue injury, surgery, or vascular event such as a myocardial infarction or stroke. A 33-year-old woman is being evaluated in clinic for pain in her left lower leg. She underwent an arthroscopic meniscus repair of the left knee three months ago. She denies any recent trauma. Patient reports sudden onset of pain and burning sensation in her leg. It does not worsen with physical activity or elevation. She denies fever or chills. On physical exam her left leg is extremely erythematous, warm, swollen and tender to the lightest touch. Lower extremity pulses are 2+ bilaterally. Initial lab work reveals a normal complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein. What is the most likely diagnosis?A) CellulitisB) Complex regional pain syndromeC) ErysipelasD) Peripheral vascular disease D) Periapical abscess Acute pain, swelling, and mild tooth elevation is characteristic of a periapical abscess. Exquisite sensitivity to percussion or chewing on the involved tooth is a common finding. Periapical abscesses occur when there is significant erosion of the pulp with bacterial overgrowth and are usually associated with dental caries or nonviable teeth. Treatment is with antibiotics (penicillin), appropriate analgesia, and dental follow-up within 48 hrs. An 18-year-old man presents to the ED with acute tooth pain. He has a history of multiple dental caries, but this pain has been gradually worsening over the past two days. On exam, tooth #31 is exquisitely tender to percussion and has a large eroded area of enamel. There is swelling seen in the surrounding gingiva but not in the buccal or submandibular soft tissues. The patient is afebrile with no other complaints. What is the most likely diagnosis?A) Acute tooth fractureB) Alveolar osteitisC) Ludwig's anginaD) Periapical abscess D) FlecainideFlecainide is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery or structural heart disease because of the increased risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Flecainide is a class IC antiarrhythmic and is an effective agent against both ventricular and supraventricular dysrhythmias. Which of the following antiarrhythmic medications is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery or structural heart disease?A) AmiodaroneB) DofetilideC) DronedaroneD) Flecainide This patient has a pH 7.32 with a decreased serum bicarbonate and therefore has a metabolic acidosis. A patient's arterial blood gas is noted to have a pH 7.32, pCO2 32 mm Hg, HCO3 16 mmol/L. Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this arterial blood gas? No, because the chloride level is similarly diluted. In cases of hyperglycemia, should the sodium level be corrected prior to calculating the anion gap? C) DiphenhydramineThe girl has clinical findings of anticholinergic poisoning that consists of hyperthermia, tachycardia, mydriasis, and dry skin. A four-year-old girl is seen at the ED because of possible ingestion. She was unattended for several minutes when she went through her grandmother's bag containing bottles of bethanecol, clonidine, diphenhydramine, and fluoxetine. Upon arrival at the ED, her examination reveals temperature of 38°C, heart rate of 120, respiratory rate of 16, blood pressure 85/56, pupils 5 mm equal and reactive and dry skin. Which of the following is the most likely medication that caused the girl's findings?A) BethanecolB) ClonidineC) DiphenhydramineD) Fluoxetine Pyridoxine (vitamin B6) to prevent peripheral neuropathy. Hypertensive vasculopathy,the result of long-standing hypertension, is the leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage. The result of degenerative changes and eventual rupture of small penetrating arteries that branch off major intracerebral arteries What is the most common cause of nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage in adults? D) Referral for surgical consultation and pain medication as neededLaboratory studies are usually non-contributory but can be useful in ruling out common duct obstruction (elevated bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase) and pancreatitis (elevated lipase) which can occur when gallstones move out of the gallbladder. Patient presents with biliary colic as a result of cholelithiasis (gall stones). What management is indicated?A) Administer antibiotics and admit for observationB) Admit patient for cholecystectomyC) Obtain CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis D) Referral for surgical consultation and pain medication as needed Charcot's triad is fever, jaundice and right upper quadrant pain. This triad is suggestive of ascending cholangitis. What is Charcot's triad and what is its significance? No interventionTelemetry observation (C) is not required in type 1 second-degree heart block because it does not typically progress into other forms of heart block. A 52-year-old man presents from his primary care physician's office for evaluation of an abnormal electrocardiogram. His ECG reveals Type 1 second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. He has no symptoms. What is the appropriate intervention? What infectious etiology is associated with complete heart block? altered structure and function of the right ventricleCor pulmonale is the result of pulmonary hypertension associated with diseases of the lung, upper airway, pulmonary vasculature or chest wall. Cor pulmonale is the result of pulmonary hypertension and is not due to left-sided heart disease (D). Which of the following best describes cor pulmonale?A) Altered structure and function of the left ventricleB) Altered structure and function of the right ventricle C) Congenital heart diseaseD) Right-sided heart disease due to left-sided heart disease What is the most common cause of cor pulmonale in the United States? A diastolic low-pitched decrescendo murmur best heard at the cardiac apex would be the most likely auscultatory finding on exam. This woman likely has mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease. A 28-year-old south Asian immigrant who is in her second trimester of her first pregnancy presents to the emergency department complaining of worsening dyspnea, orthopnea and lower extremity edema. She has never experienced anything like this before. She has no past medical history; however, she admits to frequent sore throats and ear infections as a child. Which of the following is most likely to be heard on auscultatory exam? D) Suction curetteThe most important condition to evaluate in a woman with postmenopausal pelvic bleeding is endometrial cancer. The cornerstone of diagnosis is based on endometrial sampling. Several modalities are available, but the easiest, most convenient and most cost-efficient process is accomplished in the outpatient setting through the use of an aspiration device, such as suction curette. A postmenopausal woman presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding. You suspect endometrial malignancy, and refer the patient for further investigation. Which of the following modalities is used in determining a diagnosis?A) ColposcopyB) Dilation and curettageC) Papanicolaou testD) Suction curette B) Salmonellanontyphoidal Salmonellosis is the most common cause of foodborne disease.

A 7-year-old boy is contipated. Everything else fine. What is the most appropriate initial intervention for this child? What is the most common cause of lower intestinal obstruction in neonates? The treatment of SCFE is operative stabilization, and children with SCFE should be referred promptly to an orthopedic surgeon. The clinical presentation of the girl is consistent with slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). Nothing has been done yet. next best step in management? C) Pericardial knock= an accentuated heart sound occurring slightly earlier than a third heart sound. This would not be expected in restrictive cardiomyopathy. Conversely, an audible S3 is frequently present in persons with restrictive cardiomyopathy because of the abrupt cessation of the rapid ventricular filling. A patient is being evaluated for dyspnea and lower extremity swelling. On physical exam the patient has jugular venous distention with inspiration and 2 + pedal edema. Hepatojugular reflex is present. The patient has clear lung fields and no murmur is appreciated.

A) BradycardiaB) HyperreflexiaC) HypotoniaD) Perioral paresthesias D) Fresh frozen plasmaThis patient has non-allergic angioedema, likely hereditary angioedema with his brother's history of the same reaction. Patients have a deficiency of the C1 esterase inhibitor causing an increased production of bradykinin due to activation of the kallikrein-kinin system. Fresh frozen plasma contains the C1 inhibitor and its administration may help stop the angioedema. A 21-year-old man presents with severe swelling of the left side of his tongue and his left upper lip. He tells you his brother had the same problem 2 years ago. Which of the following is the most effective treatment?A) CryoprecipitateB) DiphenhydramineC) EpinephrineD) Fresh frozen plasma Hemophilia B (also referred to as Christmas disease, named after the first person diagnosed with the condition) is caused by a deficiency of factor IX, a factor involved in the intrinsic coagulation cascade. In the severe form (< 1% of factor activity), the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), which measures this cascade, will be abnormal. Factor IX has a longer half-life than factor VIII and therefore, patients with hemophilia B do not require transfusions as often as those with hemophilia A Which of the following lab tests will be abnormal in patients with severe hemophilia B?A) Activated partial thromboplastin timeB) Bleeding timeC) D-dimerD) Prothrombin time C) Ceftriaxone plus doxycyclineNeisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis are the pathogens most commonly identified in patients with PID.

Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacologic treatment?A) AzithromycinB) CeftriaxoneC) Ceftriaxone plus doxycyclineD) Metronidazole B) Excision microsurgeryAcoustic neuromas, - Sensorineural hearing impairment is the main symptom, while tinnitus, balance disturbance and headache is somewhat common and vertigo is rare. - There are three general management steps: monitoring, surgery or stereotactic radiation. If the tumor is slow growing and causing minimal, non-progressive symptoms, it may be monitored. A 44-year-old woman complains of progressive unilateral hearing loss. She now is almost deaf in her left ear. In addition, her physical examination is significant for balance deficits. MRI scanning shows a large tumor arising from the vestibular division of the eighth cranial nerve. Which of the following is the recommended management of this tumor?A) ChemotherapyB) Excision microsurgeryC) Serial monitoringD) Stereotactic radiation B) Fast inward sodium channel blockadeThis patient is exhibiting signs and symptoms of a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) overdose. TCAs act by fast inward sodium channel blockade, causing QRS complex widening (> 100 ms) on ECG. Management of TCA toxicity includes administration of sodium bicarbonate to combat the sodium channel blockade if there is widening of the QRS complex on ECG or telemetry. A 21-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department after an intentional ingestion. On physical examination, she is lethargic, flushed, hot to the touch, and her pupils are dilated. Vital signs include BP 130/90 mm Hg, HR 130 beats/minute, and RR 22 breaths/minute. After several minutes, she has a generalized tonic clonic seizure. What is the mechanism by which this class of medications causes cardiac toxicity? A) AV nodal blockadeB) Fast inward sodium channel blockadeC) Inhibition of the sodium/potassium-ATPase pumpD) Rapid outward potassium channel blockade D) Salmonella spp.This patient has osteomyelitis of the distal femur. Patients with sickle cell have an increased risk of osteomyelitis overall, especially from Salmonella spp. Additionally, Salmonella spp. are the most common pathogen identified in sickle cell patients with osteomyelitis. 5-year-old boy with sickle cell disease presents with a limp, which his mother noticed 2 days ago. On exam, the patient is well appearing. Vital signs are significant for fever with temperature of 38.1°C. Heart rate and blood pressure are normal. The patient demonstrates an antalgic gait, and there is warmth and tenderness to palpation of the soft tissues in the distal thigh. Lab tests show a normal WBC count and elevated CRP and ESR. Plain radiographs of the femur show soft tissue swelling in the distal thigh as well as a periosteal reaction in the distal femur. Knee radiographs are normal. What is the most likely infecting organism?A) Haemophilus spp.B) Klebsiella sppC) Pseudomonas spp.D) Salmonella spp. D) Repeat Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing in one year A 32-year-old woman presents to your office for a physical exam including a Papanicolaou test (Pap smear). Lab results reveal negative cytology and positive human papillomavirus (HPV). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?A) Counsel patient on safe sex practicesB) Order colposcopyC) Repeat Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing in five yearsD) Repeat Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing in one year infectious endocarditis.Risk factors for infectious endocarditis include rheumatic heart disease, congenital or acquired valvular disease, and intravenous drug use. In an IV drug user, coverage should include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in addition to the typically implicated organisms. The most appropriate antibiotics for this patient would include cefepime and vancomycin. A 42-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with fever, chills, cough, and hemoptysis. He has a history of intravenous opioid use. Vital signs include BP 110/65 mm Hg, HR 120 beats per minute, RR 20 breaths per minute, and T 103.4°F. Chest X-ray is shown above. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis A) Carbamazepine prescriptionTrigeminal neuralgia = is manifested by intermittent episodes of severe pain in the distribution of the fifth cranial nerve. The antiepileptic carbamazepine is the medical treatment of choice for this condition. A 42-year-old woman presents with severe facial pain. The patient reports she has had episodes of severe, shooting pain on the lower half of the left side of her face. Her neurologic examination is normal. She cannot identify any triggers for the episodes of pain. Which of the following is the appropriate next step?A) Carbamazepine prescriptionB) CT scan of the headC) Prednisone prescriptionD) Referral for EEG D) Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillinThis patient presents with signs and symptoms concerning for meningitis.

What antibiotics should be administered?A) Ampicillin aloneB) Ceftriaxone aloneC) Ceftriaxone and vancomycinD) Ceftriaxone, vancomycin and ampicillin A) Human papillomavirus vaccine Both types of the Human papillomavirus vaccine are given as a three-dose series in persons who initiated HPV vaccination at ages 15 through 26 years, so this patient is due for her third dose. A 17-year-old presents for a well-child visit. She is healthy and has no complaints. A review of her past immunizations shows that she is up to date on all required immunizations at her 8-year-old well child visit. She also received the Human papillomavirus vaccine at age 15 and 16, and quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine and TdaP at age 12. Which one of the following vaccines should she receive at this visit?A) Human papillomavirus vaccine B) Inactivated poliovirusC) MeaslesD) Rubella B) Grab as close to the tick's head with forceps and pull upwarduse tweezers or forceps, grab the tick's head as close to the skin as possible, and gently pull upward. The goal is to avoid crushing or tearing the tick's head or body because this can induce regurgitation of infectious contents or leave behind its body parts, a possible nidus for infection or a granulomatous reaction. An 8-year-old boy is brought to the ED by his parents after they discovered a tick attached to his right armpit. What is the best way to remove the tick?A) Coat the tick in petroleum jellyB) Grab as close to the tick's head with forceps and pull upwardC) Immerse the tick in isopropyl alcoholYour AnswerD) Immerse the tick in normal salineE) Tie a suture around the tick's body and pull upward What is the most common neurological symptom from second-stage Lyme disease? A) ApneaThe patient in this vignette has a ductal-dependent cardiac lesion that requires a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) to preserve blood flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. At approximately 1 week of age, the PDA may close and cause sudden cardiovascular collapse. PGE1 infusion is potentially life-saving, but it is important to be aware of its adverse reactions. For example, apnea is a known adverse reaction of PGE1 infusion; therefore, it is important to secure the airway with endotracheal intubation prior to its infusion. A 1-week-old boy born at full term to a 16-year-old primigravida mother with no complications presents to the ED for lethargy. In the ED, his vital signs are T 37°C, HR 166, RR 82, and pulse oximetry of 80%. On exam, he is lethargic with diffuse pulmonary rales and rhonchi, cold extremity, and decreased peripheral pulses.

A 20-year-old man who is employed in construction presents with pain to his thumb and wrist for 4 months. He states that the pain worsens while he is working. Examination reveals pain along the radial surface of the wrist with forced ulnar abduction. What management is indicated?A) MRI of the wristB) NSAIDs and thumb spica splintC) Surgical release of the dorsal extensor compartmentD) Wrist X-ray with ulnar deviation view Volkmann's contracture This patient has classic findings of acute compartment syndrome. Volkmann's contracture may occur from an untreated compartment syndrome or an arterial injury A patient presents to the Emergency Department with complaints of increasing pain in the right lower extremity. He has a history of a non-displaced proximal tibial fracture treated with application of a long leg cast 2 days prior. On exam there is marked swelling of the toes and the patient refuses to move them secondary to pain. An injection of meperidine fails to relieve the patient's pain. Clinical intervention is needed to prevent what complication? Compartment syndrome characterized by a pathological increase of pressure within a closed space and results from edema or bleeding within the compartment. It may occur as an early local complication of fracture. An 18-year-old patient has a tibia/fibula fracture following a motorcycle crash. Twelve hours later the patient presents with increased pain despite adequate doses of analgesics and immobilization. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? Compartmental pressures should be obtained as soon as possible. If they are elevated this is a surgical emergency. A 38 year-old male sustained a fracture of the left distal tibia following a 25-foot fall and is taken to the operating room for an open reduction internal fixation of the distal tibia. Sixteen hours post-op, the patient develops sustained pain, which is not relieved with narcotics. On passive range of motion of the toes the patient ""yells"" in agony. The patient also states that the top of his foot has decreased sensation. On physical examination the physician assistant notes that the leg is swollen and the foot is cool to touch. Based upon this information what diagnostic testing should be done? Loss of two-point discrimination (dorsal columns)can be the earliest sign of compartment syndrome A 35 year-old male placed in a thumb spica cast for a scaphoid fracture presents complaining of forearm and hand pain that is not relieved with pain medication and elevation. Which of the following is the earliest physical exam sign for his current condition? IV rehydration with crystalloids for 24 to 72 hours is the mainstay of therapy for rhabdomyolysis 25 year-old male presents to the ED with left calf pain and cramping, as well as nausea and vomiting. He admits to ""partying with cocaine all night"". He describes his urine as a dark brown color. Serum creatinine kinase (CK) is 1325 IU/L (Normal Range 32-267 IU/L). Which of the following is the initial mainstay of therapy for this condition? A positive Rovsing's sign can be elicited in a patient with appendicitis when increased pain occurs in the right lower quadrant upon palpation of the left lower quadrant. A patient presents with abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant, examination reveals increased pain in the right lower quadrant on deep palpation of the left lower quadrant. This commonly known as which of the following? High suspicion for ectopic pregnancy should be maintained when any possible pregnant woman presents with vaginal bleeding or abdominal pain. A 26 year-old gravida 0 sexually active female presents to the emergency room complaining of colicky pain in her lower abdomen for the past 12 hours. She passed out earlier in the day while trying to have a bowel movement. Her last menstrual period was 6 weeks ago. She has noted vaginal spotting over the last 24 hours. Vital signs show Temp 37 degrees C, BP 96/60mmHg, P 110, R 16, Oxygen Sat. 98%. Abdominal exam is positive for distension and tenderness. Bowel sounds are decreased. Pelvic exam shows cervical motion and adnexal tenderness. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? 22 year-old male presents to the clinic complaining of scrotal pain that radiates into the groin. Patient admits to being a weightlifter and was lifting 24 hours prior to this pain developing into the scrotum. The patient admits to being sexually active with only his male partner. Examination reveals a reddened scrotum and it is difficult to distinguish the epididymis from the testes on the right side. Elevation of the right testicle brings relief of the pain. This is known as a positive Tamoxifen is the adjuvant therapy of choice in post-menopausal estrogen receptor positive axillary node negative breast cancer.

What is considered the most common physical examination finding for intestinal obstruction?A DistentionB Fluid waveC RigidityD Tenderness Hypoparathyroidism (Hypocalcemia secondary to hypoparathyroidism)Hypocalcemia secondary to hypoparathyroidism is commonly seen as a complication of thyroidectomy. Hypocalcemia + Low intact PTH + High Phosphate is diagnostic An adult presents with a three month history of , extremity and which began shortly after a thyroidectomy for a malignant thyroid lesion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? C) needle thoracotomy right 2nd intercostal spaceHint: This patient has a tension pneumothorax on the right, and insertion of the chest tube on the left would be life threatening. Pay attention to SIDE A 22 year-old patient complains of sudden onset of chest pain accompanied by shortness of breath. The patient appears dyspneic. On examination, the trachea is deviated to the left, breath sounds are faint on the right, and the right chest is hyperresonant to percussion. The preferable treatment for this patient would beA) a tracheostomy.

C) lumbar punctureAlthough 95% of subarachnoid hemorrhages show blood on head CT, the remaining do not show evidence of hemorrhaging. A lumbar puncture should then be performed and the fluid examined for red blood cells or xanthochromia. In suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage with a negative head CT, which of the following studies should be used to help establish the diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage?A complete blood countB lipid profileC lumbar punctureD electrocardiogram D) remove bloodA large volume hemothorax is treated by immediate insertion of a large bore thoracostomy tube to (1) drain existing blood and clot, (2) quantify the amount of bleeding, (3) reduce the risk of fibrothorax, and (4) permit apposition of the pleural surfaces in an attempt to reduce hemorrhage. Hint: Pleurodesis is a procedure by which an irritant is placed into the pleural space following chest tube drainage and lung re-expansion. Which of the following is the recommended treatment of a large volume hemothorax?A perform pleurodesisB drain the empyemaC administer antibioticsD remove blood Squamous cell cancer is common in patients with a smoking history and presents with a central mass, hilar adenopathy and mediastinal widening. typically presents with peripheral masses. lung cancer typically presents with peripheral masses Episodes of hemoptysis. Chest x-ray reveals a hilar nodule with hilar adenopathy and mediastinal widening. What is the most likely diagnosis?A Large cell lung cancerB AdenocarcinomaC BronchiectasisD Squamous cell lung cancer D) Intermittent longitudinal mucosal ulcers and fissuresUlcerations tend to be linear with transverse fissures in Crohn's disease. These skip (intermittent) lesions are common with Crohn's disease. Hint: Rectal pseudopolyps and diffuse ulceration and bleeding are associated with ulcerative colitis rather than Crohn's.

Hint: While blood cultures are indicated in acute cases of osteomyelitis, they are only positive in 25-50% of pediatric hematogenous osteomyelitis and 10% of other forms of bone infection. Hint: Taking specimens for culture from a sinus tract or the base of an ulcer correlate poorly with organisms infecting the bone The most reliable site from which to identify the causative organism in cases of osteomyelitis is theA base of ulcer.B blood.C sinus tract.D bone The combination of fine needle aspiration and radioisotope scanning of a solitary thyroid nodule provides the best diagnostic yield. Because , they are generally referred for surgical removal. It is not reasonable to delay the diagnosis. Hint: Ultrasound is preferred over MRI or CT scan of the thyroid A 24-year-old male is initially found to have a single nodule in the right lobe of his thyroid gland. He is clinically and chemically euthyroid. The next step is toA reassure the patient and reassess yearly.B recheck in 1-3 months.C do a fine needle aspiration.D obtain a CT scan of the neck. D) hematuriaThe most common presenting symptom/sign of renal cell carcinoma is hematuria (approximately 60%). Flank pain or abdominal mass is present in about 30% of new cases. Hint: Renal cell cancer may present with HYPERcalcemiaHint: Renal cell cancer may present with polycythemia, NOT ANEMIA. most commonly presents with which of the following symptoms or signs?A hypocalcemiaB inguinal painC anemiaD hematuria B) decreased CVP; decreased BP; increased pulse rateHypovolemic shock is a condition with a decrease in the amount of circulating blood volume in the intravascular system. A decrease in the amount of circulating volume will result in a decrease in the CVP pressure which is an indirect measurement of the amount of blood in the right ventricle. Less blood in the vascular system means decreased blood pressure. Since there is less blood in the circulation, the body will attempt to compensate for this by increasing the number of contractions (pulse rate) and the force of those contractions due to increased sympathetic stimulation. A patient with hypovolemic shock would most likely exhibit which of the following signs?A) increased CVP; decreased BP; increased pulse rateB) decreased CVP; decreased BP; increased pulse rateC) increased CVP; increased BP; decreased pulse rateD) decreased CVP; increased BP; decreased pulse rate C) cefotaxime (3rd gen cephalosporin)Cefotaxime provides coverage for osteomyelitis caused by staphylococcus or salmonella. Hint: Norfloxacin is contraindicated in children because Fluoroquinolones may cause growth plate arrest, tendon rupture and damage to articular cartilage. (CI in < 18y and pregnant women)Codeine might relieve pain, but will not treat the cause of osteomyelitis. Aspirin is not indicated for the treatment of osteomyelitis. 6-year-old child with sickle cell anemia presents with fever and pain over the right tibia. There is tenderness along the anterior tibia, but no pain with motion of the knee or ankle. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?A aspirinB codeineC cefotaximeD norfloxacin venography = the most accurate method for diagnosis in the lower legHint: While impedance plethysmography (non-invasive medical test that measures small changes in electrical resistance; These measurements reflect blood volume changes), physical exam findings, and Doppler ultrasound are useful in diagnosing thrombophlebitis, venography is the most accurate method for diagnosis in the lower leg. The most accurate method of diagnosing thrombophlebitis of the lower leg isA) impedance plethysmography.B) physical exam findings.C) Doppler ultrasound.D) venography A) increase in hydrationKeeping the urine dilute is the most effective strategy to prevent crystal accumulation in the urine and the development of urinary stones. The most effective preventive strategy to prevent recurrence of renal lithiasis is which of the following?A increase in hydrationB early treatment of urinary tract infectionC limitation of calcium intakeD use of probenecid D) pleural effusionHint: Consolidation from pneumonia would have an increased tactile fremitus.Hint: pneumothorax is HYPERresonant to percussionHint: Asthma is HYPERresonant to percussion because it is an obstructive disease (traps air) lobe with decreased tactile fremitus and dullness to percussion. Which of the following is the most likely cause?A asthmaB consolidationC pneumothoraxD pleural effusion A) Aortic dissection (The scenario presented here is typical of an ascending aortic dissection.)Hint: In an acute myocardial infarction the pain builds up gradually. Hint: Cardiac tamponade may occur with a dissection into the pericardial space; syncope is usually seen with this occurrence. Hint: Pulmonary embolism is usually associated with dyspnea along with chest pain. A 60 year-old male is brought to the ED complaining of severe onset of chest pain and intrascapular pain. The patient states that the pain feels as though ""something is ripping and tearing"". The patient appears shocky; the skin is cool and clammy. The patient has an impaired sensorium. Physical examination reveals a loud diastolic murmur and variation in blood pressure between the right and left arm. Based upon this presentation what is the most likely diagnosis?A) Aortic dissectionB) Acute myocardial infarctionC) Cardiac tamponadeD) Pulmonary embolism B) Arterial thrombosisArterial thrombosis has occurred and is evidenced by the loss of the popliteal and dorsalis pedis pulse. This is a surgical emergency. Venous occlusion and thrombophlebitis do not result in loss of arterial pulse. A 56 year-old male with a known history of polycythemia suddenly complains of pain and paresthesia in the left leg. Physical examination reveals the left leg is cool to the touch and the toes are cyanotic. The popliteal pulse is absent by palpation and Doppler. The femoral pulse is absent by palpation but weak with Doppler. The right leg and upper extremities has 2+/4+ pulses throughout. Given these findings what is the most likely diagnosis?A Venous thrombosisB Arterial thrombosisC Thromboangiitis obliteransD Thrombophlebiti - Cardiac compression will manifest with distended neck veins and cold clammy skinHint: widened pulse pressure is associated with aortic regurgitationHint: Pulmonary edema not typically seen. More likely to see peripheral edemaHint: Early diastolic murmurs are associated with pulmonary regurgitation A 22 year-old male received a stab wound in the chest an hour ago. The diagnosis of pericardial tamponade is strongly supported by the presence ofA) pulmonary edema.B) wide pulse pressure.C) distended neck veins.D) an early diastolic murmur C) Vertebral spineHint: Long bones are most commonly affected with osteomyelitis in children. The bones of the vertebral spine are most commonly affected in a patient with osteomyelitis. Organisms reach the well-perfused vertebral body of adults via spinal arteries and quickly spread from the end plate into the disk space and then to the adjacent vertebral body. The infection may originate in the urinary tract and intravenous drug use carries an increased risk of spinal infection Adults and intravenous drug abusers, which of the following bones is most commonly affected with acute osteomyelitis?A) FemurB) HumerusC) Vertebral spineD) Tibia 63 year-old female presents with a complaint of chest pressure for one hour, noticed upon awakening. She admits to associated nausea, vomiting, and shortness of breath. 12 lead EKG reveals ST segment elevation in leads II, III, and AVF. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A Aortic dissectionB Inferior wall myocardial infarctionC Acute pericarditisD Pulmonary embolus B) disseminated intravascular coagulationDisseminated intravascular coagulation is characterized by bleeding from many sites as all coagulation factors are consumed and then broken down, leading to decreased fibrinogen level and platelet count, prolonged PT and PTT, and presence of fibrin split products.Hint: ABO incompatibility results in immediate hemolysis and shock. Hint: Idiopathic thrombocytopenia is characterized by decreased platelet count, but coagulation factors are normal. Hint: With inadequate repair of liver lac, Bleeding would be localized only and would result in shock if lacerations of the liver were not repaired properly. A 26 year-old female required 12 units packed red blood cells during a trauma resuscitation and surgical repair of liver and splenic lacerations. The patient is now 6 hours postoperative and has blood oozing from the suture line and IV sites. There is bloody urine in the Foley bag. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates a platelet count of 10,000/microliter, prolonged prothrombin level, and the presence of fibrin split products. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) acute ABO incompatibility reactionB) disseminated intravascular coagulationC) exacerbation of idiopathic thrombocytopeniaD) inadequate repair of the liver lacerations A) alpha-adrenergic blockerAlpha-adrenergic blockers are used preoperatively to control hypertension in a patient with pheochromocytoma that occurs from unopposed alpha stimulation when the tumor is manipulated.Hint: Beta-adrenergic blockers are used to control tachycardia and arrhythmias, if present, after the hypertension has been controlled. While awaiting operative removal of pheochromocytoma, which of the following classes of medications are used for control of hypertension? A alpha-adrenergic blockerB beta-adrenergic blockerC ACE inhibitorD diuretic C) Pseudomonas aeruginosaPseudomonas aeruginosa is frequently associated with osteomyelitis involving puncture wounds of the foot. This is believed to result from direct inoculation with P. aeruginosa via the foam padding found in tennis shoes. Hint: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common infecting organism in cases of acute osteomyelitis, however, the mechanism of injury in this case suggests P. aeruginosa. A 22 year-old female complains of worsening pain, swelling, and tenderness in her left heel for 1 week. She sustained a penetrating injury to the heel two weeks ago when she stepped on a nail while running in tennis shoes. Examination reveals a draining puncture wound with surrounding erythema and exquisite tenderness. X-ray of the left foot demonstrates periosteal reaction associated with the wound. Which organism is classically responsible for this infection?A Escherichia coliB Streptococcus pyogenesC Pseudomonas aeruginosaD Staphylococcus aureus D) Tube thoracostomyThis patient has a hemothorax. Drainage of a hemothorax is best obtained through insertion of a chest tube (tube thoracostomy). A 42 year-old male is brought to the emergency department with a stab wound to his right lateral chest wall. On physical examination, the patient is stable with decreased breath sounds on the right with dullness to percussion. An upright chest x-ray reveals the presence of a moderate pleural effusion. Subsequent diagnostic thoracentesis contains bloody aspirate. Which of the following is the next most appropriate intervention?A ThoracotomyB Needle aspirationC Close observationD Tube thoracostomy C) Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilationIndications for early endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation in treatment of flail chest include patients that are over the age of 65, have comorbid lung disease and associated severe head trauma. Other indications include shock, three or more associated injuries and fracture of eight or more ribs.Hint: While application of elastic binders and adhesive tape was historically utilized to stabile the chest, this intervention has been found to decrease chest expansion and worsen lung atelectasis. On physical examination there is evidence of head trauma. The left side of the chest wall appears to move inward with inspiration and outward with expiration. A chest x-ray reveals multiple rib fractures on the left. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?A) Surgical fixation of the fractured ribsB) Application of elastic binders and adhesive tape C) Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilationD) Chest physiotherapy that encourages frequent coughing C) Cardiac transplantationCardiac transplantation is effective, with survival rates of 80-90% in 1 year, 60-70% over 5 years.

Which of the following can optimize quality of life and is a definitive treatment for a patient with refractory heart failure?A) Ventricular assist deviceB) Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsationC) Cardiac transplantationD) Partial resection of the left ventricle C) Open reduction and ulnar gutter splint immobilizationOpen reduction is indicated with angulation of greater than 40 degrees. Hint: Reduction followed by splinting is recommended for fifth metatarsal fractures with angulation of 15-40 degrees. A 22 year-old male presents several hours after sustaining a hand injury when he punched a wall. X-rays of the hand demonstrate fracture of the fifth metacarpal neck with and a claw hand. What is the most appropriate intervention?A) Antibiotic treatment and ulnar gutter splint immobilizationB) Closed reduction and ulnar gutter splint immobilizationC) Open reduction and ulnar gutter splint immobilizationD) Ulnar gutter splint immobilization only C) Volar forearmThe volar forearm splint is best for temporary immobilization of forearm, wrist and hand fractures and is the . Hint: A volar splint with is used to immobilize the first metacarpophalangeal joint and is useful for A 60 year-old female injured her right wrist when she slipped and fell onto her outstretched hand. Radiographs show a fracture through the metaphysis of the distal radius with dorsal displacement and angulation. Which of the following splints is the best method of temporary immobilization?A Dorsal forearmB Ulnar gutterC Volar forearmD Volar with thumb spica A) Reassurance that the discoloration is an expected finding.This is indicative of migratory ecchymosis and expected after insertion of a pacemaker. A 26 year-old female presents to clinic with a left arm that is swollen and non-tender with bluish discoloration along the upper arm and forearm. She is status post pacemaker insertion in the left upper chest for third degree heart block, one week ago. Pulses are present and the arm is warm, but not red. The pacemaker incision is healing well despite a hematoma and tenderness at the site. Which of the following statements would be appropriate patient education about this condition?A) Reassurance that the discoloration is an expected finding.B) Apply cold compresses to the site of the hematoma.C) Elevation of the involved extremity will increase the swelling.D) Aspirin should be taken to help manage pain. D) Lateral radiographCervical spine x-rays are most commonly used as the initial screen for cervical spine injury. A cervical spine series consists of a lateral view, anteroposterior (AP) view, and an odontoid view. The lateral view detects up to 80% of traumatic spine injuries. An 18 year-old male is involved in a motor vehicle accident with a question of cervical spine fracture. What is the imaging test of choice to initially evaluate this patient and clear his cervical c-spine?A Positron emission tomographyB Magnetic resonance imagingC Computed tomographyD Lateral radiograph UrethrogramA urethrogram is the only procedure that should be done to evaluate this type of injury as urethral integrity may have been compromised secondary to the pelvic fracture. Blood at the meatus is the most important finding of suspected urethral injury. Hint: An IVP can be done as part of an evaluation for hematuria however it is rarely used today. Hint: A VCUG is done to evaluate urinary reflux in children A 29 year-old male is involved in a motor vehicle crash. On the secondary survey it is noted that there is blood at the meatus and the patient is suspected of having a pelvic fracture. The patient is otherwise stable. Which of the following tests should be done to evaluate the urinary system?A Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)B Intravenous pyelogram (IVP)C UrethrogramD Renal arteriography B) CT scan of the orbitCT scan of the orbit is the study of choice to evaluate a suspected blowout fracture An 18 year-old male who was struck in the left eye with a baseball presents with ocular pain, periorbital ecchymosis, and restricted upward gaze. Which of the following is the diagnostic study of choice in this patient?A Zygomatic arch x-rayB CT scan of the orbitC UltrasonographyD Fluorescein staining A) CT urographyCT urography with and without contrast should be done to evaluate the upper and lower urinary tract for neoplasms, and benign conditions such as urolithiasis. This has replaced IVP for imaging of the upper tracts. Abdominal ultrasound will not help in this scenario and the role of renal ultrasound in evaluation of hematuria is unclear. Cystoscopy will help to assess the bladder and urethra but will not help with evaluation of the upper urinary tract. A 48 year-old female presents to the clinic complaining of hematuria. The patient states that she was found to have hematuria during an insurance physical examination. The patient denies dysuria or frequency. She also denies pain in the abdomen, flank or meatus. She denies any history of previous nephrolithiasis. Urinalysis reveals the urine to be yellow and slightly hazy with a positive dipstick for hemoglobin.

Hint: While fluid hydration is indicated, a stone greater than 6 mm will typically not spontaneously pass and surgical therapy is indicated. A 40 year-old patient with a history of recurrent kidney stones presents with acute onset of right flank pain and hematuria. The patient is afebrile and pain is poorly controlled on oral medications. On CT scan a 1 cm stone is noted in the renal pelvis. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient?A AntibioticsB Shock wave lithotripsyC UreterolithotomyD Fluid hydration A) increased fluid production due to increased hydrostatic pressureA transudative pleural effusion occurs in the setting of normal capillary integrity and suggests the absence of local pleural disease. Chronic heart failure accounts for 90% of transudates. Hypoalbuminemia, cirrhosis, and acute atelectasis are also causes of a transudate. Which of the following is the pathophysiologic process of a transudative pleural effusion?A) increased fluid production due to increased hydrostatic pressureB) decreased lymphatic clearance of fluid from the pleural spaceC) infection in the pleural spaceD) bleeding into the pleural space C) nafcillin, gentamicin, and metronidazoleNafcillin provides treatment for penicillinase-resistant organisms Gentamicin covers many gram negative aerobes, and metronidazole is effective against a wide variety of anaerobic bacteria. Hint: Metronidazole, clindamycin, and cefoxitin essentially have the same spectrum of activity. They are effective against gram-negative anaerobes A patient with a bowel perforation secondary to a gunshot wound is being prepped for surgery. Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment includes which of the following?A cefoxitin and gentamicinB vancomycin and penicillin GC nafcillin, gentamicin, and metronidazoleD metronidazole, clindamycin, and cefoxitin C) compartment syndromeCompartment syndrome is characterized by a pathological increase of pressure within a closed space and results from edema or bleeding within the compartment. It may occur as an early local complication of fracture. *Hint*: Avascular necrosis occurs primarily in muscles post-traumatically and may not arise for several months after an injury. *Hint*: Myositis ossificans is a late complication of fracture resulting from disruption of the blood supply to the bone. tment syndrome is characterized by a pathological increase of pressure within a closed space and results from edema or bleeding within the compartment. It may occur as an early local complication of fracture. *Hint*: Avascular necrosis occurs primarily in muscles post-traumatically and may not arise for several months after an injury. *Hint*: Myositis ossificans is a late complication of fracture resulting from disruption of the blood supply to the bone. : Reflex sympathetic dystrophy is characterized by painful wasting of the hand muscles that may be secondary to injury and could occur as a late complication. An 18-year-old patient has a tibia/fibula fracture following a motorcycle crash. Twelve hours later the patient presents with increased pain despite adequate doses of analgesics and immobilization. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A avascular necrosisB myositis ossificansC compartment syndromeD reflex sympathetic dystrophy C) Volkmann's contractureThis patient has classic findings of acute compartment syndrome. Volkmann's contracture may occur from an untreated compartment syndrome or an arterial injury. *Hint*: Osteomyelitis results from a source of infection that may include an open fracture, but not a closed fracture. *Hint*: Traumatic arthritis only occurs as a result of fractures that involve the articular surface. : Osteomyelitis results from a source of infection that may include an open fracture, but not a closed fracture. *Hint*: Traumatic arthritis only occurs as a result of fractures that involve the articular surface. : Malunion of the fracture fragments occur when there is poor reduction of the fracture fragments. Non-displaced fractures do not require reduction. A patient presents to the Emergency Department with complaints of increasing pain in the right lower extremity. He has a history of a non-displaced proximal tibial fracture treated with application of a long leg cast 2 days prior. On exam there is marked swelling of the toes and the patient refuses to move them secondary to pain. An injection of meperidine fails to relieve the patient's pain. Clinical intervention is needed to prevent what complication?A) osteomyelitisB) traumatic arthritisC) Volkmann's contractureD) malunion of fracture fragments D) Compartment pressureCompartmental pressures should be obtained as soon as possible. If they are elevated this is a surgical emergency.Hint: Doppler studies will confirm the presence of a decreased pulse. Hint: A. X-rays of the lower leg and ankle will only determine bone placement. A 38 year-old male sustained a fracture of the left distal tibia following a 25-foot fall and is taken to the operating room for an open reduction internal fixation of the distal tibia. Sixteen hours post-op, the patient develops sustained pain, which is not relieved with narcotics. On passive range of motion of the toes the patient ""yells"" in agony. The patient also states that the top of his foot has decreased sensation. On physical examination the physician assistant notes that the leg is swollen and the foot is cool to touch. Based upon this information what diagnostic testing should be done?A X-ray of the lower leg and ankle.B Doppler studies.C Bone scan.D Compartment pressure B) Loss of two-point discriminationLoss of two-point discrimination can be the earliest sign of compartment syndromeHint: Peripheral pulses are poor indicators of compartment syndrome as they remain intact until late.Hint: Pain with passive stretch is a subjective finding early and must be differentiated from pain of the original injury. Although a reliable finding it may be difficult to reproduce in the cast. A 35 year-old male placed in a thumb spica cast for a scaphoid fracture presents complaining of forearm and hand pain that is not relieved with pain medication and elevation. Which of the following is the earliest physical exam sign for his current condition?A Slow capillary refillB Loss of two-point discriminationC Absent peripheral pulsesD Pain with passive stretch A) IV rehydrationIV rehydration with crystalloids for 24 to 72 hours is the mainstay of therapy for rhabdomyolysis.Hint: NSAIDS, such as Toradol (Ketorolac), should not be used due to the vasoconstrictive effects on the kidneys.Hint: Fasciotomy is indicated for compartment syndrome 25 year-old male presents to the ED with left calf pain and cramping, as well as nausea and vomiting. He admits to ""partying with cocaine all night"". He describes his urine as a dark brown color. Serum creatinine kinase (CK) is 1325 IU/L (Normal Range 32-267 IU/L). Which of the following is the initial mainstay of therapy for this condition?A IV rehydrationB FasciotomyC Toradol (Ketorlac)D Hydrotherapy B) NephrolithiasisA sudden onset of severe colicky flank pain associated with nausea and vomiting as well as the absence of rebound or direct testicular tenderness makes nephrolithiasis the most likely diagnosis. This is further supported by the presence of hematuria on the urinalysis.Hint: The absence of fever, as well as non-tenderness to palpation of the testes, suggests a renal rather than gonadal cause of the patient's symptoms.Hint: While bladder cancer may have associated microscopic hematuria, it presents with painless hematuria or irritative voiding symptoms. A 42 year-old male presents complaining of a sudden onset of a severe intermittent pain originating in the flank and radiating into the right testicle. He also complains of nausea and vomiting. On examination the patient is afebrile, but restless. Examination of the abdomen reveals tenderness to palpation along the right flank with no rebound or direct testicular tenderness. Urinalysis reveals a pH of 5.4 and microscopic hematuria, but is otherwise unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A Bladder cancerB NephrolithiasisC Acute appendicitisD Acute epididymitis C) acute pyelonephritis.Acute pyelonephritis presents with flank pain, fever, and generalized muscle tenderness.

X-ray findings occur from the dilated and pulsatile intercostal arteries and the ""3""is due to the coarctation site with proximal and distal dilations.Hint: Thoracic outlet syndrome occurs when the brachial plexus, subclavian artery, or subclavian vein becomes compressed in the region of the thoracic outlet. It is the most common cause of acute arterial occlusion in the upper extremity of adults under 40 years old. A 12-year-old boy presents to the office with pain in his legs with activity gradually becoming worse over the past month. He is unable to ride a bicycle with his friends due to the pain in his legs. Examination of the heart reveals an ejection click and accentuation of the second heart sound. Femoral pulses are weak and delayed compared to the brachial pulses. Blood pressure obtained in both arms is elevated. Chest x-ray reveals rib notching. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A abdominal aortic aneurysmB pheochromocytomaC coarctation of the aortaD thoracic outlet syndrome B aortic root dilationhis patient has the signs and symptoms consistent with Marfan's syndrome. Ectopia lentis, aortic root dilation and aortic dissection are major criteria for the diagnosis of the disease.Hint: Patients with Marfan's syndrome commonly have mitral valve prolapse and possibly aortic regurgitation (high frequency diastolic murmur at the third right intercostal space). Right atrial enlargement, pulmonic stenosis and ventricular septal defect are not commonly seen. A 19 year-old female presents with complaint of palpitations. On examination you note the patient to have particularly long arms and fingers and a pectus excavatum. She has a history of joint dislocation and a recent ophthalmologic examination revealed ectopic lentis. Which of the following echocardiogram findings would be most consistent with this patient's physical features?A right atrial enlargementB aortic root dilationC pulmonic stenosisD ventricular septal defect C ultrasound of the abdomenAn abdominal ultrasound can delineate the transverse and longitudinal dimensions of an abdominal aortic aneurysm and may detect mural thrombus. Abdominal ultrasound is best used to screen patients at risk for the development of this conditionHint: Although some abdominal aortic aneurysms are calcified, abdominal radiography may demonstrate the calcified outline of the aneurysm. However, about 25% of aneurysms are not calcified and cannot be visualized by plain x-ray.Hint: Contrast aortography is used commonly for the evaluation of patients with aneurysms before surgery, but it has no role in the serial assessment of patients being followed on a chronic basis. A 56 year-old male presents to the office with a history of abdominal aortic aneurysm. He was told that he will need on going evaluation to assess whether the aneurysm is expanding. What is the recommended study to utilize in this situation?A plain film of the abdomenB serial abdominal examC ultrasound of the abdomenD angiography of the abdominal aorta B tamoxifenTamoxifen is the adjuvant therapy of choice in post-menopausal estrogen receptor positive axillary node negative breast cancer.Hint: Bisphosphonate therapy is used in breast cancer patients with metastasis disease for the bone.Hint: While ovarian ablation is a form of hormonal therapy, it is not the initial treatment of choice.Hint: Chemotherapy is indicated in breast cancer with tumors larger than 1 cm in size. Postmenopausal patient is diagnosed with grade I breast cancer. The tumor is 0.7 cm in size, estrogen-receptor positive, and axillary nodes are negative. After undergoing a lumpectomy, which of the following adjuvant therapy is indicated for this patient?A chemotherapyB tamoxifenC ovarian ablationD bisphosphonate therapy D transfer to a burn center.Reasons for transfer to a burn center include a partial thickness burn covering greater than 10% of total body surface area. In addition, burns in patients with pre-existing medical conditions, such as diabetes, that could complicate their management, prolong recovery, or affect their outcome, is also a reason for transfer to a burn centerHint: If used in the care of a burn patient, the antibiotic selected should have activity against Pseudomonas and S. aureus. Cefazolin does not have any antipseudomonal activity A 28 year-old female with diabetes mellitus type 2 sustains a partial thickness burn to her left upper arm and her chest when hot grease spilled on her at home. The burn to her arm is circumferential and the estimated total body surface burned is 18%. She has no allergies. The most appropriate treatment of this patient would includeA outpatient application of silver sulfadiazine.B debridement of all intact blisters.C IV cefazolin (Ancef, Kefzol).D transfer to a burn center. C HyperparathyroidismThe majority of patients with hyperparathyroidism are asymptomatic. Recurrent nephrolithiasis may be one of the presentations of primary hyperparathyroidism. Measurement of parathyroid levels would be the initial laboratory test for the evaluation of hypercalcemia.Hint: Hypercalcemia may be the earliest manifestation of a malignancy and this must be investigated. Most often the signs and symptoms of a malignancy will cause the patient to seek medical care. Malignancy is the second leading cause of hypercalcemia, behind hyperparathyroidism. Nulliparity is a risk factor for breast cancer and the most common presenting sign in a breast mass. A 72 year-old female is being evaluated for recurrent kidney stones. PE reveals no abnormal findings. Laboratory findings show elevated calcium and decreased phosphate levels. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A PheochromocytomaB Adrenal insufficiencyC HyperparathyroidismD Breast cancer B Mitral valve replacementMVR is the definitive intervention to correct MR caused by papillary muscle ruptureHint: CABG may be necessary if significant blockage is found, but it will not correct the mitral regurgitation. A 56 year-old female four days post myocardial infarction presents with a new murmur. On examination the murmur is a grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur radiating to the axilla. She is dyspenic at rest and has rales throughout all her lung fields. Blood pressure is 108/68 mmHg, pulse 70 bpm. Which of the following would be the definitive clinical intervention?

When should she receive the rubella vaccine?A) During the first trimester of pregnancyB) During the second trimester of pregnancyC) During the third trimester of pregnancyD) After delivery of the infant A) Refer to a gynecologist for biopsyVulvular squamous cell hyperplasia causes thickening and hyperkeratosis of the vulva. The lesions are red and moist and cause intense pruritus over time the area becomes thickened and a white plaque may develop. Biopsy must be done to evaluate for intraepithelial neoplasm or invasive tumor. A 72 year-old female presents with vulvular pruritus for the last nine months, which has progressively worsened over the last two months. She states that she went through menopause at age 54 and has been on estrogen and progesterone therapy since that time. Physical examination reveals red lesions with white plaques on the vulva.

She denies performing self-breast exams and any family history of breast or gynecologic cancers. On palpation of her left breast, a solitary 1 cm rubbery, firm, well-circumscribed, non-tender breast mass is noted. In review of her records, similar findings were noted on last year's examination. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) fibroadenomaB) breast fat necrosisC) fibrocystic changesD) intraductal papilloma A) uterine atonyUterine atony is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Predisposing factors include any conditions that cause excessive uterine enlargement, abnormal labor or conditions that interfere with uterine contraction.Hint: Retained placental tissue only acccounts for 5-10% of postpartum hemorrhage and usually occurs later.Hint: Genital tract trauma may lead to lacerations of the lower genital tract that cause postpartum hemorrhage, however this is much less common than uterine atony. Which of the following is the most common underlying cause of early postpartum hemorrhage?A) uterine atonyB) genital tract traumaC) coagulation disordersD) retained placental tissue B) elevation of blood pressureHint: Headache and visual disturbances indicate severe pre-eclampsia and are late findings that indicate a need to deliver the fetus.Hint: Since weight gain and edema are common occurrences during pregnancy, they are less reliable indicators of pre-eclampsia. Most current sources no longer list them as diagnostic criterion for pre-eclampsia.Hint: While proteinuria is a defining diagnostic criterion of pre-eclampsia, it is a late finding and may not be present even with eclampsia. Which of the following is the earliest and most reliable clinical manifestation of pre-eclampsia?A onset of proteinuriaB elevation of blood pressureC excessive weight gain and edemaD headache and visual disturbances A) decrease in estrogenHint: While there is a slight decrease in testosterone levels during menopause, this has not be shown to be responsible for the majority of menopausal symptomsHint: Progesterone and androstenedione levels both decrease, not increase, in the menopausal female patient and therfore can not account for any menopausal symptoms. Which of the following is the most significant factor in the production of menopausal symptoms?A) decrease in estrogenB) decrease in testosteroneC) increase in progesteroneD) increase in androstenedione D) fetal distressPassage of meconium is associated with fetal distress usually due to asphyxiaHint: Meconium passage occurs most commonly in post-term deliveries, not pre-term deliveries. Passage of meconium is related to mature development of the gastrointestinal tract and is rarely seen before 36 weeks gestationHint: Prolonged labor, not fast labor, is associated with potential passage of meconium into the amniotic fluid. Which of the following is associated with meconium-stained amniotic fluid during labor?A) transitionB) prematurityC) fast laborD) fetal distress D) 1-hour post-Glucola blood glucoseGlucose screening, usually with a 1-hour Glucola, is routinely performed between 24-28 weeks gestation to evaluate for glucose intoleranceHint: A serological test for syphilis, usually the VDRL, is part of the routine obstetrical tests ordered at a patient's initial prenatal visit.Hint: Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein testing is routinely done between 15-18 weeks gestation to screen for neural tube defects. A 29 year-old female presents for routine prenatal visit at 26 weeks gestation. She has no complaints and has completed all the initial routine obstetrical diagnostic tests to date. Her physical examination and all initial diagnostic evaluations are unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic test to order at this time?A VDRLB amniocentesisC maternal serum alpha-fetoproteinD 1-hour post-Glucola blood glucose C) history of salpingitisHint: While high levels of estrogen and progesterone are thought possibly to increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy because these hormones slow the movement of the fertilized egg through the fallopian tube, no proven association has been established.Hint: Alcohol intake has not been associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy.Hint: Advanced maternal age, not younger maternal age, is an established risk factor for ectopic pregnancy. Which of the following is a major risk factor for an ectopic pregnancy?A alcohol intakeB young maternal ageC history of salpingitisD low dose oral contraceptive use A) valacyclovir (Valtrex)This patient most likely has herpes genitalis which may be treated with oral antivirals, such as valacyclovir, that will reduce the duration of viral shedding and shorten the duration of symptoms. A 24 year-old female presents with complaints of dysuria associated with fever, malaise, myalgias and headache for the past 3 days. Today she noticed some lesions on her genitalia. Physical examination reveals the presence of multiple clear vesicles and erythematous ulcers with tender bilateral inguinal adenopathy. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?A valacyclovir (Valtrex)B metronidazole (Flagyl)C ceftriaxone (Rocephin)D benzathine penicillin G (Bicillin) B) threatened abortionVaginal bleeding that occurs prior to the 20th week of gestation is classified as a threatened abortion. Pain is usually not a major feature and vaginal examination usually reveals a closed cervical os.Hint: Vaginal bleeding and cramp-like lower abdominal pain are usually present in an . The cervical os is also frequently partially open.Hint: Vaginal bleeding accompanied by cramp-like pain, cervical dilatation, and passage of some products of conception constitutes an .Hint: After all products of conception are passed, the uterus contracts and vaginal bleeding stops. The cervical os closes, but the uterus is smaller than the suspected gestational age following a . 27 year-old G1P0 female presents complaining of painless spotting since this morning. She is known to be 12 weeks pregnant. Pelvic examination reveals the presence of blood within the vagina with a closed cervical os. The uterus is consistent with a 10-12 week gestation and nontender to palpation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A inevitable abortionB threatened abortionC incomplete abortionD complete abortion B) endometrial biopsyPostmenopausal bleeding is a primary complaint in patients with endometrial cancer. The only reliable method of diagnosis is by endometrial biopsy.Hint: Pap smears are the diagnostic tool of choice to evaluate for cervical cancer. The Pap smear is not reliable in diagnosing endometrial cancer, but in a small percentage of patients may show atypical endometrial cells which necessitates follow-up with an endometrial biopsy. A 65 year-old postmenopausal female presents with complaints of new onset of vaginal bleeding. She relates a history of two episodes of vaginal bleeding during the past month, each lasting about four days. Which of the following diagnostic evaluations is the to evaluate the suspected diagnosis?A) Pap smearB) endometrial biopsyC) serum prolactin levelD) serum FSH and LH levels D) colposcopy with endocervical curettageColposcopy with endocervical curettage and directed biopsy of suspicious lesions is the appropriate evaluation of a high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) Pap smear result.Hint: HPV DNA testing is recommended for initial evaluation of an ASC-US result on a Pap smear. If HPV testing is positive, colposcopy is then indicated. If negative, the Pap smear is repeated in 12 months.Hint: A pelvic ultrasound or abdominopelvic CT scan is indicated when repeat abnormalities are seen on a Pap smear, however all diagnostic studies have failed to reveal the source of cellular abnormality.Hint: Repeat Pap smears in 4-6 months may be done in evaluation of ASC-US Pap smear results after treatment with either appropriate therapy for vaginal infection or intravaginal estrogen therapy for menopausal patients with atrophic changes. A 32 year-old female G4P4 with a history of multiple sexual partners is seen in follow-up for recent findings of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) on a Pap smear.

Current recommendations include use in patients with a high risk of ovarian cancer due to family history or BRCA gene statusHint: Oral hormonal contraceptives are one of the acceptable treatments for primary dysmenorrhea as periods are less painful due to suppression of ovulation. Which of the following is a contraindication to prescribing oral hormonal contraceptives?A) history of iron deficiency anemiaB) history of dysmenorrhea since age 15C) positive family history of ovarian cancerD) history of smoking in a patient older than age 35 Which of the following is the most common presenting clinical manifestation of breast cancer?A breast tendernessB nipple dischargeC nipple retractionD breast mass An increased incidence of breast cancer is associated withA nulliparity.B late menarche.C trauma to the breast.D early natural menopause. D) mobile flagellated protozoa on a normal saline preparationTrichomonas presents with a frothy discharge, irritative symptoms of pruritus, dysuria, and frequency, and the flagellated protozoa are demonstrated on a saline preparation.Hint: Clue cells are seen in Gardnerella vaginalis infections, but the vaginal discharge is grayish and has an unpleasant fishy odor.

It is also indicated at 28 weeks gestation and within 72 hours of delivery of an Rh-positive infant. In which of the following maternal-fetal blood type pairings should the mother receive Rho-GAM?A A positive mother, O negative infantB A negative mother, O negative infantC AB positive mother, spontaneous abortionD AB negative mother, spontaneous abortion C) primary dysmenorrheaThis patient most likely has primary dysmenorrhea supported by onset of pain within 1-2 years after onset of menarche and characteristic symptoms of low, mid-abdominal, spasmodic cramping pain that radiates to the back or inner thighs beginning on the first or second day of menstruation. Pelvic examination fails to reveal any pathological findings.Hint: Premenstrual syndrome is seen primarily in females that are 25-40 years old. Associated physical and emotional symptoms appear 7-14 days before the onset of menses and resolve once menstruation begins. A 13 year-old female presents with a six month history of lower mid-abdominal pain that is spasmodic in nature and radiates to the inner thighs. The pain usually starts within a few hours of the onset of menses and lasts about 2 days. The patient's menarche began 2 years ago. She denies any sexual activity. Physical examination, including pelvic, is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) ovarian cystB) endometriosisC) primary dysmenorrheaD) premenstrual syndrome B) Remember the = Dysmenorrhea, Dyspareunia, Dyschezia!! associated with cyclic premenstrual pelvic pain / low back painWith endometriosis, the uterus is often fixed and retroflexed in the pelvis. The palpable mass is an endometrioma or . The patient with endometriosis also often has dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia. A 26 year-old monogamous female presents with cyclic pelvic pain that has been increasing over the last 6 months. She complains of significant dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia.

It works by inhibiting calcium transport through slow-type channels, causing reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and tocolysis. What is the treatment of magnesium sulfate toxicity?A NifedipineB TerbutalineC Potassium carbonateD Calcium gluconate A) Total abdominal hysterectomyAtypical adenomatous hyperplasia contains cellular atypia and mitotic figures in addition to glandular crowding and complexity. This has a 20-30% risk of progression to endometrial cancer and the recommendation is hysterectomy.Hint: C) Endometrial curettage would remove the hyperplasia and progesterone will decrease the endometrial glandular proliferation. This would be appropriate management in a patient with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia.Hint: Observation and biopsy again in 3 months would increase the risk of endometrial cancer for this patient.Hint: Oral progesterone for 10 days of the month will cause the patient to have a withdrawal bleed every month. This would be an appropriate treatment in a premenopausal patient with endometrial hyperplasia without atypia A 52 year-old obese patient with persistent heavy menses undergoes an endometrial biopsy and is diagnosed with atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. What is the next step in the management of this patient?A) Total abdominal hysterectomyB) Observation and endometrial biopsy in 3 monthsC) Endometrial curettage followed by progesterone dailyD) Oral progesterone days 16-25 of the month for 6 months and repeat biopsy D) Uteroplacental insufficiencyHint: Fetal hypoxia would be a concern if deep late FHR decelerations were present with absent beat-to-beat variability.Hint: Early decelerations are due to head compression of the fetus. Pressure on the fetal head causes an alteration in cerebral blood flow causing a central vagal stimulation and subsequent FHR deceleration. The deceleration is a mirror image of the contraction.Hint: Variable decelerations are from cord compression. The decelerations have a sharp, angular, decline in FHR with duration less than 2 minutes. A 23 year-old female is in active labor and has progressed from 3 cm to 6 cm in the last six hours. Fetal monitoring demonstrates mild repetitive late decelerations. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this finding?A) Fetal hypoxiaB) Head compressionC) Cord compressionD) Uteroplacental insufficiency B) Mittelschmerz (unilateral pelvic discomfort associated with ovulation and the production of progesterone)Women may experience pain at the time of ovulation, may alternate side to side.Hint: With endometriosis, the uterus is often fixed and retroflexed in the pelvis. The palpable mass is an endometrioma or ""chocolate cyst"". The patient with endometriosis also often has dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia.Hint: Functional ovarian cysts occur from ovulation and are not usually symptomatic.Hint: Patients with pelvic inflammatory disease often present with fever, pain, and more acute symptoms. A 16 year-old G0P0 patient presents complaining of lower pelvic pain that alternates from right to left side of her pelvis. She states that it is related to her cycle and occurs most commonly midcycle. She denies sexual activity. She reports that she has taken ibuprofen at the time of the discomfort with some relief. Her pelvic examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A EndometriosisB MittelschmerzC Functional ovarian cystD Pelvic inflammatory disease C) enhance fetal lung maturity.Corticosteroids may be given from 24-34 weeks in patients with preterm labor or who have pregnancy complications which may cause premature birth. The corticosteroids enhance pulmonary maturity.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) Candida vaginitisB) Bacterial vaginosisC) Trichomonas vaginitisD) Chlamydia trachomatis C) Staphylococcus aureusThe most common pathogen associated with postpartum mastitis is Staphylococcus aureus which arises from the nursing infant's throat and nose Mastitis associated with breastfeeding is most commonly caused by what bacteria?A Listeria monocytogenesB Escherichia coliC Staphylococcus aureusD Streptococcus pyogenes D) Colposcopy and endometrial sampling this is the appropriate workup for One of the 4 Bethseda system subgroups of . Colposcopy is a medical diagnostic procedure to examine an illuminated, magnified view of the cervix. Colposcopy and endometrial sampling are important to perform in patients with AGUS Pap results because glandular cells are associated with squamous and glandular precursor lesions and carcinoma.Hint: Colposcopy with ECC would be recommended in patients with ASCUS, LGSIL, HGSIL, or squamous cell findings on a Pap smearHint: Repeat Pap smear would be recommended in patients with ASCUS, not AGUS, results on a Pap smear.Hint: HPV DNA testing is recommended to further evaluate patients with Pap smears with dysplasia. A 40 year-old female presents with a Pap smear abnormality revealing atypical glandular cells (AGUS). What is the most appropriate intervention?A) HPV DNA testingB) Colposcopy with endometrial curretage(ECC)C) Repeat Pap smear in 3 monthsD) Colposcopy and endometrial sampling A) Pregnancyessential to exclude by a serum or urine pregnancy test. What is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea?A) PregnancyB) Ovarian failureC) Imperforate hymenD) Hypothalamic amenorrhea D) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)The FTA-ABS and the MTA-TP are specific treponemal tests used for the confirmation of syphilis.Hint: The RPR is a non-specific test. False positives are common.Hint: The VDRL if positive must by confirmed with an additional testing because of a large number of false positives including bacterial and viral infections, pregnancy, chronic liver disease, connective tissue disorders.Hint: The Weil-Felix agglutination test is used for rickettsial infections not syphilis. Which of the following tests is the most specific for the diagnosis of syphilis?A) Rapid plasma reagin (RPR)B) Weil-Felix agglutination testC) Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)D) Fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) B) Second trimester of pregnancyDiastolic blood pressure and the mean arterial pressure reach their nadir at 16-20 weeks of gestation.

The birth control method that would be best for this patient is which of the following?A) Vaginal ringB) Transdermal patchC) Combined oral contraceptive pillD) Levonorgestrel releasing IUD C) Laparoscopy with biopsyDiagnosis of endometriosis must be made by direct visualization. Laparoscopy with biopsy is the most appropriate diagnostic study in this patient A 24 year-old sexually active woman presents to the clinic complaining of dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia and backache that occurs premenstrually. Pelvic examination shows pain upon uterine motion and uterosacral nodularity in the posterior vaginal fornix. The definitive diagnosis for this patient requires which of the following?A Pelvic ultrasoundB CT of the abdomenC Laparoscopy with biopsyD CA-125 test A) Iron deficiencyIron deficiency anemia is responsible for 95% of anemias during pregnancyHint: Folic acid deficiency anemia is common where nutrition is inadequate A pregnant 28 year-old female presents at 30 weeks gestation complaining of fatigue and headache. Her vital signs and physical examination are normal. Routine hemoglobin screening is 10.1 g/dL. Peripheral smear shows microcytic, hypochromic red blood cells. Besides the physiologic dilution of pregnancy, what type of anemia is most likely in this patient?A Iron deficiencyB Folic acid deficiencyC ThalassemiaD Hereditary spherocytosis C) Continue her yearly women's health examinationsThe patient is advised to have regular pelvic exams. The limited prevalence of ovarian cancer and the lack of sensitivity and specificity of current available tests have so far prevented the implementation of routine ovarian cancer screening of the general population.Hint: BRCA 1-2 has been found to be associated with ovarian cancers in approximately 5% of cases. However the expression of this gene in BRACA 1-2 carriers are unpredictable. Therefore, routine testing for this gene has limited value at this timeHint: The CA-125 recognizes the antigen CA-125 which is present in serous ovarian tumors but not in mucinous or nonepithelial ovarian tumors however the test is not considered a cost effective screening test.Hint: Refined imaging techniques offer promise for the future however much work remains before these tests are considered accurate or cost effective screening tests. 56 year-old female presents to the clinic wanting testing for ovarian cancer. Her best friend was just diagnosed with Stage 4 primary cancer of the ovary. She denies family history of breast or ovarian cancer. According to screening guidelines, which of the following do you recommend?A BRCA 1-2 gene testingB A pelvic ultrasound yearlyC Continue her yearly women's health examinationsD CA-125testing A) Prevention of convulsionsMagnesium sulfate is used to prevent and treat eclamptic seizures. Magnesium sulfate is not sufficient to treat hypertension, therefore antihypertensives must be added. Magnesium sulfate is excreted solely from the kidneys and urine output must be preserved to prevent accumulation of the drug. Magnesium sulfate does nothing to prevent HELLP syndrome. Which of the following best describes the purpose of intravenous magnesium sulfate in patients with preeclampsia?A Prevention of convulsionsB Prevention of HELLP syndromeC Lowering of blood pressureD Reversal of proteinuria A 25 year-old female presents for a routine gynecological examination. You palpate a 2 cm breast mass in her right breast. Her menstrual period was last week. She has no family history of breast cancer. What is the modality of choice to further evaluate her breast mass?A Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)B Excisional biopsyC UltrasoundD Mammography C) UltrasoundIn a 25 year-old an ultrasound is the best choice because of the density of the breast tissue in young women.Hint: Mammographies are not recommended in women prior to the age of 35 without family history of breast cancer or BRCA positive.Hint: MRI's of the breast are done in patients with prior breast cancer or who have BRCA 1 or 2 positivity.Hint: Excisional biopsy is not indicated without differentiation of lesion by ultrasound. 25 year-old female presents for a routine gynecological examination. You palpate a 2 cm breast mass in her right breast. Her menstrual period was last week. She has no family history of breast cancer. What is the modality of choice to further evaluate her breast mass?A Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)B Excisional biopsyC UltrasoundD Mammography B) SyphilisThe primary lesion of syphilis presents as a painless ulcer or chancre. Secondary syphilis presents with a skin rash lymphadenopathy and mucocutaneous lesions.Hint: The classic presentation of herpes is a painful vesicle.Hint: Granuloma inguinale presents with raised, red lesions that bleed easily.Hint: Chancroid presents with a painful genital ulcer and tender suppurative inguinal adenopathy. A 26 year-old woman requests screening after her boyfriend was treated for a sexually transmitted infection recently. On examination you find a painless vulvar ulcer. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) HerpesB) SyphilisC) ChancroidD) Granuloma Inguinale D) Hospitalization with parenteral doxycycline and cefoxitinThis patient has pelvic inflammatory disease and most likely a tubo-ovarian abscess. It is recommended that the patient be hospitalized and treated with high-dose IV antibiotic therapy. For patients with tubo-ovarian abscesses, surgical drainage is often necessary. A 16 year-old nulliparous acutely ill female presents with bilateral lower abdominal pain. She has a temperature of 100.4 degrees F and on examination has a tender, enlarged left adnexa. Cervical culture is positive for Chlamydia. Ultrasound reveals a complex tubular structure in the left adnexal area. What is the recommended treatment?A Outpatient treatment with IM ceftriaxone and oral doxycyclineB Oral doxycyclineC IM procaine penicillinD Hospitalization with parenteral doxycycline and cefoxitin D) 35 year-old woman with regular cyclesWomen with regular menstrual cycles are most likely to have dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is caused by a excess of prostaglandin F 2 alpha. Prostaglandin production increases under the influence of progesterone, reaching a peak at, or soon after, the start of menstruation.Hint: Young teenagers who have just started their menses are unlikely to have dysmenorrhea, because they usually are anovulatory for up to one year.Hint: Marathon runners are often amenorrheic or have oligoamenorrhea. They do not have dysmenorrhea because dysmenorrhea is a function of ovulatory cycles. Dysmenorrhea would most likely occur in which of the following patients?A A young teenager who just started having her mensesB A woman on birth control pillsC A marathon runner with one menses per yearD A 35 year-old woman with regular cycles B) Inevitable abortion = the gross rupture of membranes in the presence of cervical dilation.Hint: Threatened abortion is characterized by bleeding in the first trimester without loss of fluid or tissue.Hint: Incomplete abortion is when the cervical os is open and allows passage of blood. The products of conception may remain in utero or may partially extrude through the open os.Hint: Complete abortion refers to a documented pregnancy that spontaneously passes all of the products of conception. A 25 year-old female, G2 P1001, presents to your office at 11-weeks gestation with vaginal bleeding, mild lower abdominal cramping, and bilateral lower pelvic discomfort. On examination, blood is noted at the dilated cervical os. No tissue is protruding from the cervical os. The uterus by palpation is 8-9 weeks gestation. No other abnormalities are found. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) Threatened abortionB) Inevitable abortionC) Incomplete abortionD) Complete abortion D) Cesarean section prior to onset of labor and rupture of membraneCesarean section performed prior to the onset of labor and rupture of membranes significantly reduces the risk of perinatal HIV transmission. Planned cesarean section delivery at 38 weeks of gestation to prevent perinatal transmission of HIV is recommended in women with a viral load of >1000 copies/mL. Which of the following is recommended to reduce the risk for perinatal transmission of HIV in a patient with a viral load of >1000 copies/mL?A Vaginal delivery with female condomB Episiotomy to shorten second stage of laborC Use of forceps or vacuum extractor to shorten second stage of laborD Cesarean section prior to onset of labor and rupture of membrane A) Increased second heart sound split with inspirationdue to the increased blood flow across the aortic and pulmonic valves.Hint: Diastolic murmurs in pregnancy should be considered pathological and evaluated furtherHint: Facial edema in uncommon in pregnancy and if it occurs, the medical provider should consider preeclampsia.Hint: Hyperreflexia occurs with preeclampsia and does not occur in a normal pregnancy On physical examination of a pregnant patient, which can be considered a normal finding?A Increased second heart sound split with inspirationB Diastolic murmurC Facial edemaD Hyperreflexia C) Pap smear in 3yearsWomen who have had 3 consecutive negative annual Pap smears results may be screened every 2 or 3 years if they are 30 or older with no history of CIN 2 or 3, immunosuppression, HIV infection, or diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in utero. When is the recommendation for the next Pap smear in a 36 year-old patient with a history of 3 consecutive negative annual Pap smears and no history of cervical dysplasia?A Yearly Pap smearsB Pap smear in 4 yearsC Pap smear in 3yearsD Patient does not need any further Pap smears C) Uterine leiomyomataUterine leiomyomata (fibroid) typically presents with severe dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia. An enlarged, irregular uterus is noted on examination.Hint: endometritis = Fever (>38 C or 100.4 F), tachycardia, abdominal pain, and uterine tenderness after c-sectionHint: Endometriosis = Cyclic premenstrual pelvic pain, Dysmenorrhea, Dyspareunia, DyscheziaHint: Endometrial hyperplasia can cause menorrhagia but is not usually a cause of dysmenorrhea. Endometrial stripe > 4 mm. Due to continuous unopposed estrogens, ex: within 3 years of estrogen only therapy in postmenopausal women. A 48 year-old G3P3003 female presents to the office complaining of severe secondary dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia over the last 6 months. On physical examination her uterus feels enlarged and irregular. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) EndometritisB) EndometriosisC) Uterine leiomyomataD) Endometrial Hyperplasia B) Second degreeHint: A first degree tear involves the vaginal mucosa or perineal skin, but does not involve the underlying tissue. They are often so small that few or no stitches are required. Hint: Second-degree lacerations go deeper, into the underlying tissue and muscles but not into the rectal sphincter. These tears need to be stitched closed, layer by layer.Hint: A third degree tear extends through to the rectal sphincter, but not into the rectal mucosa.Hint: A fourth degree tear extends all the way into the rectal mucosa. goes through the anal sphincter and the tissue underneath it. Your patient has just delivered her baby vaginally without difficulty. The patient has a laceration of the vaginal mucosa including the perineal body. You repair it without difficulty. On the chart you document this as what type of tear?A) First degreeB) Second degreeC) Third degreeD) Fourth degree C) OvulationOvulation occurs within 30-36 hours of the LH surge and at the time of elevated estrogen.Hint: Secretory phase occurs when estrogen is elevated.Hint: The follicular phase begins with the onset of menses (day 1 of the menstrual cycle) and ends on the day of the LH surge.Hint: Progesterone causes differentiation of the endometrial components and converts proliferative endometrium into a secretory endometrium. What phase of the female menstrual cycle occurs at the time of elevated estrogen and LH/FSH surge?A Follicular phaseB Proliferative phaseC OvulationD Secretory phase B) Perform a conization of the cervixA conization of the cervix is recommended in this case because there is a substantial discrepancy between the screening Pap test and the histologic data from biopsy and ECC. Additionally the ECC is positive for disease in this case. Colposcopic examination of the cervix of a 38 year-old woman with a high-grade lesion on Papanicolaou (Pap) smear yields a positive endocervical canal curettage (ECC) as its only abnormality. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in this patient?A) Repeat the Pap smear in 3 monthsB) Perform a conization of the cervixC) Repeat the colposcopic examination in 3monthsD) No follow-up is required A) Chadwick's signChadwick's sign is a bluish discoloration of the vagina early in pregnancy; it usually appears by 12 weeks of gestation. Which of the following physical examination findings is present in a 12 week singleton pregnancy?A Chadwick's signB Uterus palpable at the level of the umbilicusC Blood pressure lower than non-pregnant stateD Hyperreflexia A) Change maternal positionVariable decelerations occur from umbilical cord compression and oligohydramnios. They are treated by changing maternal positioning to relieve pressure on the umbilical cord. Additionally, amnioinfusion may be used to relieve umbilical cord compression in cases of oligohydramniosHint: Delivery of the baby by c-section is not indicated in variable FHR decelerations and may be harmful to the baby. You are following a patient in labor at term. You evaluate the fetal monitoring tracing and note the presence of variable, repetitive decelerations in the heart rates. The contractions have a sharp deceleration slope. What is the recommended treatment for these decelerations?A Change maternal positionB Administer tocolytic therapyC Apply vibroacustic stimulationD Perform cesarean section B) Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PPA), beta-hCG, and ultrasound of nuchal transparencyPregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PPA), beta-hCG, and ultrasound of nuchal transparency are screening tests done at 10-13 weeks of gestation.Hint: Maternal serum alpha feto protein, beta hCG, estriol, and inhibin-A, are included in the quad screen which is a screening test done in the second trimester from 15-20 weeks of gestation.Hint: Amniocentesis is a diagnostic test not a screening test.Hint: Level II ultrasound is done in the second trimester. What is the recommended initial first trimester screening test for fetal aneuploidy?A AmniocentesisB Pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PPA), beta-hCG, and ultrasound of nuchal transparencyC Maternal serum alpha feto protein, beta-hCG, estriol, and inhibin-AD Level II ultrasound C) Ectopic pregnancyAn ectopic pregnancy will have an abnormally low hCG level because the hCG will not double every 48 hours as a normal pregnancy would.Hint: Quantitative hCG levels are excessively elevated for the gestational age of the pregnancy. in hydatidiform moleHint: Choriocarcinoma is a persistent form of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia and will have an elevated hCG level.Hint: A twin gestation will have a higher hCG level because of the presence of two fetuses. In which of the following conditions would human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level be lower than expected for gestational age?A ChoriocarcinomaB Hydatidiform moleC Ectopic pregnancyD Twin gestations D) Oral metronidazole (Flagyl)This is a classic description of trichomonas vulvovaginitis. This condition must be treated with oral metronidazole or tinidazole. A 47 year-old perimenopausal female with vasomotor symptoms complains of vulvar itching and copious vaginal discharge with a rancid odor. Physical examination reveals erythema of the vulva and petechiae on the cervix. The pH of the vaginal discharge is five. Which of the following is the recommended treatment for this patient?A Topical metronidazole (Metrogel)B Oral fluconazole (Diflucan)C Topical estradiol (Estrace) creamD Oral metronidazole (Flagyl) A) MenorrhagiaHint: Metrorrhagia is bleeding that occurs at any time between menstrual periods.Hint: Oligomenorrhea describes menstrual periods that occur more than 35 days apart.Hint: Hypomenorrhea is usually light flow, sometimes only spotting. A 46 year-old woman describes her menstrual periods as regular (occurring every 30 days), prolonged, and with a heavy flow. You document this finding as which of the following?A MenorrhagiawB OligomenorrheaC MetrorrhagiaD Hypomenorrhea C) Blood test to look for the presence of diabetes and HIV infectionRecurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis is defined as four or more yeast infections in 1 year. The possibility of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus or immunodeficiency should be considered in women with recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis. When it has been determined that no reversible causes are present (e.g., antibiotic therapy, uncontrolled diabetes, OCP use) and initial therapy has been completed, maintenance therapy may be appropriate. Selected long-term regimens include the use of clotrimazole and fluconazole. The role of boric acid and lactobacillus therapy remains in question. 45-year-old woman is noted to have four yeast infections in 1 year. Appropriate management of this patient should beA Continued observation and treatment only if symptomaticB Further evaluation for hypothyroidismC Blood test to look for the presence of diabetes and HIV infectionD Prophylactic therapy with weekly metronidazoleE Examination for endometrial structural abnormalities B) Endometrial biopsyAbdominal ultrasound (A) is not recommended for women with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. If ultrasound needs to be used, transvaginal ultrasound is the appropriate diagnostic test to order. Postmenopausal women with an endometrial thickness < 3-4 mm on transvaginal ultrasound are unlikely to have endometrial carcinoma. Hysterectomy (C) may be indicated based on the results of the diagnostic imaging, but is not an initial step in management of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding. All women who present with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding should be evaluated with either endometrial biopsy or transvaginal ultrasound, there is no role for watchful waiting (D). A 55-year-old postmenopausal woman presents to your office with a complaint of vaginal bleeding. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?A) Abdominal ultrasoundB) Endometrial biopsyC) HysterectomyD) Watchful waiting MetronidazoleAzithromycin (A) is the treatment of choice for chlamydial cervicitis. Chlamydia infection may cause vaginal discharge in females, but often the infection is asymptomatic. On speculum exam, the cervix is erythematous and friable. Ceftriaxone (B), a third generation cephalosporin, is the drug of choice for infections with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Similar to chlamydial infection, gonorrheal infections may cause vaginal discharge, and, less commonly, may be asymptomatic. The cervix may also be erythematous and friable on speculum examination. No treatment (D) is inappropriate in a patient with symptoms and signs of bacterial vaginosis. Although bacterial vaginosis represents an overgrowth of normal anaerobic vaginal bacteria rather than an acquired infection, treatment is recommended. Adequate treatment is especially important for pregnant women, as bacterial vaginosis increases the risk of preterm delivery, chorioamnionitis, and endometritis. A 15-year-old girl presents to the Emergency Department with complaints of vaginal pruritus and discharge. She denies sexual activity. Speculum examination reveals a homogenous, grey discharge with a pH > 4.5. A wet prep reveals stippled epithelial cells. What treatment is indicated?AzithromycinCeftriaxoneMetronidazoleNo treatment What substance must be avoided during metronidazole therapy? A) Anterior cervical positionThe Bishop score is the cervical assessment system most commonly used in obstetrical clinical practice in the United States. This system tabulates a score of the likelihood of vaginal delivery following induction based upon the station of the presenting part and four characteristics of the cervix: dilatation, effacement, consistency, and position. Greater cervical dilation and effacement, softer cervix, more anterior cervical position, and great fetal station tabulate to a higher Bishop score and are associated with greater likelihood of vaginal delivery. In contrast, a low Bishop score increases the likelihood that induction will fail to result in vaginal delivery. A Bishop score ≥ 8 suggests the chances of having a vaginal delivery are goodd*, and the cervix is considered favorable, or ripe, for induction. If the Bishop score is ≤ 6, the chances of having a vaginal delivery are low, and the cervix is considered unfavorable, or unripe, for induction. Which of the following contributes to a higher Bishop score? A) Anterior cervical positionB) Cervical effacement of 0 to 30%C) Fetal station of -3 D) Firm cervical consistency Bacterial vaginosisBacterial vaginosis (BV) is an imbalance in the normal vaginal flora caused by a decrease in the concentration of hydrogen peroxide-producing lactobacillus and an overgrowth of several other microorganisms. These microorganisms vary but could include Gardnerella vaginalis, Mobiluncus spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and several anaerobic gram negative rods (Prevotella spp., Porphyromonas spp., Bacteroides spp.). Patients usually complain of an amine odor and a grayish or milky, homogenous vaginal discharge. Diagnosis is made by using a diagnostic scale called Amsel's criteria. According to this scale, three of the four criteria must be met to diagnose BV. The four criteria are: an amine odor when potassium hydroxide solution is added to vaginal secretions (otherwise known as a positive whiff test), homogenous vaginal discharge, a vaginal pH >4.5, and the presence of clue cells on microscopy. Clue cells are epithelial cells that are coated with bacteria giving them a stippled appearance. Treatment involves metronidazole or clindamycin either orally or intravaginally. Recurrent BV is common. A 16-year-old woman presents with vaginal discharge for 4 days. She describes the discharge as gray and malodorous. She denies any pain or itching. On exam, you note vaginal discharge, but no cervical or adnexal tenderness. Microscopy reveals clue cells. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?Atrophic vaginitisBacterial vaginosisCandidiasisTrichomoniasis What gram stain scoring system provides a more sensitive and specific diagnosis than wet mount? Doxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 14 daysA single 1-gram dose of azithromycin (A) is part of the regimen to treat cervicitis and urethritis in men. It can also be used for PID but should be administered once weekly for 2 weeks. The CDC no longer recommends fluoroquinolones (B) for the treatment of gonococcal infections and associated conditions such as PID due to high resistance. Metronidazole (D) is not required as part of the PID treatment regimen, but it is added sometimes to also treat trichomoniasis or vaginitis or if there is a concern for anaerobic infection. A 22-year-old woman presents with lower abdominal pain and abnormal vaginal discharge for 4 days. She is sexually active with multiple partners and does not consistently use barrier contraception. She has bilateral adnexal tenderness and yellow discharge on pelvic exam. Her urine pregnancy test is negative. In addition to a 1-time dose of ceftriaxone, what is the most appropriate outpatient course of antibiotics for the patient?Azithromycin 1 gram PO x 1Ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO BID x 14 daysDoxycycline 100 mg PO BID x 14 daysMetronidazole 500 mg PO BID x 14 days Although rare, it can take place concurrently with fertilization or throughout the 1st trimester. Does the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy rule out PID? A) Begin work-up for primary amenorrheaInducing a cycle with medroxyprogesterone (Provera) (C) is a strategy used for the treatment of secondary amenorrhea. Not initiating a work up (D) is inappropriate as primary amenorrhea is defined by age 14 if no secondary sexual characteristics have developed. Avid exercise (B) can be a cause of both primary and secondary amenorrhea, by causing functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, however this is only diagnosed after ruling out all other causes. A 15-year-old woman presents to the office with her mother concerned that she has not had a menstrual cycle. She is an avid runner, logging 20 miles per week. On exam she exhibits no breast development or axillary or genital hair. Her mother was 15 when she started her menstrual cycle. What is your next step?A) Begin work-up for primary amenorrheaB) Encourage her to stop exercising for 3 monthsC) Induce cycle with medroxyprogesterone D) No work up, but provide education on the topic What is the most common cause of secondary amenorrhea? Abnormal vaginal bleedingPresenting as asymptomatic with an abnormal Pap smear (B) is not likely in endometrial cancer. Rather, though atypical endometrial cells are occasionally seen on a Pap smear, most women will have a negative smear. Bloating and frequent urination (C) is characteristic of ovarian cancer, not early endometrial cancer. Marked lower abdominal pain (D) would not be the first symptom of endometrial cancer. Usually women with endometrial cancer do not develop pain until the cancer has metastasized or a superimposed infection has resulted. A 62-year-old woman presents for her annual well woman exam. She wants to discuss her risk of endometrial cancer, given a personal history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and prolonged tamoxifen use during her 50's. Given these risk factors she should be cautioned that early endometrial cancer normally presents in which of the following manners?Abnormal vaginal bleedingAsymptomatic with an abnormal Pap smearBloating and frequent urinationMarked lower abdominal pain Lynch syndrome should be suspected in patients with a strong family history of colon or endometrial cancer and may be grounds for more vigilant screening procedures. What is the name of the syndrome that causes hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, in addition to increasing patients' risk of endometrial cancer, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, or kidney cancer? Azithromycin and ceftriaxoneAzithromycin (A) ​alone is inadequate due to the high prevalence of chlamydia and gonorrhea co-infection. Amoxicillin (C) does not have a role in the treatment of cervicitis or urethritis. Fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin) (D) have high resistance to N. gonorrhoeae and is no longer recommended. A 15-year-old girl presents to clinic with vaginal discharge. She recently became sexually active but states that her partner does not have any symptoms of infection. Speculum examination reveals white discharge and an erythematous cervix. Bimanual examination is unremarkable. Urine PCR is positive for Chlamydia trachomatis. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment options?AzithromycinAzithromycin and ceftriaxoneCeftriaxone, amoxicillin and metronidazoleCiprofloxacin and ceftriaxone A) Ectopic pregnancyRisk factors for an ectopic pregnancy are history of pelvic inflammatory disease, current use of an intrauterine device, prior tubal ligation, prior ectopic pregnancy, and in vitro fertilization. Gestational trophoblastic disease (B) is a spectrum of obstetric diseases that includes partial and complete hydatidiform mole, invasive mole, and choriocarcinoma. Gestational trophoblastic disease is characterized by excessive nausea and vomiting, larger than expected uterus, and extremely high levels of HCG. The woman in this case had lower than expected HCG level for her six-week gestational age. A heterotopic pregnancy (C) is a combined intrauterine pregnancy and an ectopic pregnancy. The incidence of heterotopic pregnancy has been increasing in the United States as the result of increased assisted reproductive technology use. A patient with a heterotopic pregnancy can present with signs and symptoms of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy if the ectopic implanted fetus has ruptured. In this case, the intrauterine pregnancy will still be visible on ultrasound. A threatened abortion (D) typically presents with lower abdominal cramping and vaginal bleeding within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. On pelvic exam, the cervix will be closed. A threatened abortion will show an intrauterine pregnancy on transvaginal ultrasound. A 44-year-old woman with a history of hypertension presents to her primary care provider's office with complaints of nausea and vomiting. Her last menstrual cycle was six weeks ago. Two years ago she had a bilateral tubal ligation performed. On physical exam, her abdomen is nontender and her uterus is not enlarged. Pelvic exam is unremarkable. Her serum human chorionic gonadotropin level is 5,000 mIU/mL. A transvaginal ultrasound does not demonstrate an intrauterine gestational sac. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis? A) Ectopic pregnancyB) Gestational trophoblastic diseaseC) Heterotopic pregnancyD) Threatened abortion C) Increased luteinizing hormoneLH:FSH > 3 : 1 (normal is 1.5 : 1) - LH is a pituitary hormoneThe patient has manifestations of hyperandrogenism and menstrual abnormalities that are suspicious for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Increased cortisol (A) is due to hypercortisolism (Cushings) that presents with facial plethora, supraclavicular fat pads, buffalo hump, truncal obesity, and purple striae, which the patient does not have. Increased follicle-stimulating hormone (B) is present in ovarian failure, which can be due to Turner syndrome, autoimmune disease, chemotherapy, or premature menopause. Increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (D) is due to hypothyroidism and commonly manifests as fatigue, constipation, weight gain, bradycardia, coarse hair and skin. A 17-year-old girl is seen in clinic due to complaints of excessive body hair. She denies taking any medication. She has irregular menses and denies sexual activity. On exam, her BMI is 31, with moderate hirsutism on upper lip and chest, moderate acne on her face, Tanner 5 breasts and pubic hair. The rest of her exam findings are normal. Which of the following is an expected laboratory finding?A) Increased cortisolB) Increased follicle-stimulating hormoneC) Increased luteinizing hormoneD) Increased thyroid-stimulating hormone D) Weight reductionClomiphene citrate (A) is the next line of treatment if weight loss does not lead to return of ovulation. Multiple studies have shown conflicting evidence comparing the efficacy of metformin and clomiphene for ovulation induction, however clomiphene remains the first line pharmacologic agent for ovulation induction in PCOS. Gonadotropin therapy (B) is used if clomiphene citrate fails. Low-dose gonadotropin therapy is recommended over high-dose therapy. Spironolactone (C) is the first-line agent to treat hirsutism in women with PCOS and has no role in ovulation induction. it is structurally similar to testosterone so will block testosterone receptors. Teratogenic so must be used with OCP's. Combination oral contraceptives are also used to prevent hirsutism and menstrual abnormalities in patients whom do not wish to conceive, however they are not first-line. A 26-year-old obese woman with a 2-year history of increased acne, abnormal hair growth, and menstrual abnormalities presents to her obstetrician for an infertility workup. A pelvic ultrasound reveals enlarged cystic ovaries. She desires to become pregnant. Which of the following is the first line treatment?A) Clomiphene citrateB) Gonadotropin therapyC) SpironolactoneD) Weight reduction Gastrointestinal side effects such a diarrhea and abdominal cramps. Less commonly, metformin causes lactic acidosis. What are potential common side effects of metformin? Staphylococcus aureusIt is important to distinguish mastitis (cellulitis) from an abscess (requires surgical drainage) and inflammatory breast cancer (rare, but deadly). In addition to antibiotics such as dicloxacillin or cephalexin that cover for Staphylococcus aureus, the patient should be encouraged to apply warm compresses and continue breastfeeding. If the patient does not respond to antibiotics within 72 hours, the patient should be evaluated again for the possibility of breast abscess. A woman presents with right breast pain, fever, and malaise for 3 days. She has been breastfeeding her newborn child for the last 3 weeks. On exam, there is an area of focal erythema and tenderness. No mass or fluctuance is noted. What is the most likely pathogen responsible for causing her condition?Escherichia coliStaphylococcus aureusStreptococcus agalactiaeStreptococcus pyogenes Which embryologic period is associated with increased teratogenicity during organogenesis? Placental abruptionUterine rupture is a catastrophic tearing open of the uterus into the abdominal cavity. Classic signs for uterine rupture (C) include sudden tearing uterine pain with contractions with resolution of pain between contractions, vaginal hemorrhage and regression of the fetal parts. It is much less common than placental abruption in patients with no acute trauma or prior uterine scarring. Fetal distress has been found to be the most reliable presenting clinical symptom in uterine rupture. Placenta previa is diagnosed by ultrasound and occurs when the placenta tissue completely or partially covers the internal cervical os. Symptomatic placenta previa (A) usually manifests as painless vaginal bleeding in the late second or third trimester, often after sexual intercourse. This initial sentinel bleed usually is not sufficient to produce hemodynamic instability or to threaten the fetus in the absence of cervical instrumentation or cervical digital examination. Vasa previa (D) is the velamentous insertion of the umbilical cord into the membranes in the lower uterine segment resulting in amniotic blood vessels presenting in front of the fetal head. Vasa previa typically manifests as onset of hemorrhage at the time of amniotomy or spontaneous rupture of membranes. The hemorrhage is fetal blood, and exsanguination can occur rapidly resulting in immediate fetal distress. A 32-year-old gravida 2 para 1 at 33 weeks gestation presents to the emergency room for sharp abdominal pain. She has not had any prenatal care during this pregnancy. Her symptoms include vaginal bleeding, uterine pain between contractions, and fetal distress. Her first pregnancy was uncomplicated, with a vaginal delivery at term. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?Placenta previaPlacental abruptionUterine ruptureVasa previa Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)Administration of betamethasone to hasten fetal lung maturity (A) is indicated for women with preterm labor (contractions resulting in cervical dilatation) prior to 37 weeks gestation. Sterile speculum examination (C) and sterile digital cervical exam (B) are contraindicated until placenta previa is ruled out as this can lead to significant hemorrhage. A 31-year-old woman at 35-weeks gestation presents with brief painless, bright red vaginal bleeding. In addition to fetal monitoring, which of the following is the most important initial management? Administration of betamethasone to hasten fetal lung maturitySterile digital cervical exam Sterile speculum examinationTransvaginal ultrasound Prescribe a vaginal ring containing estradiolAvoidance of vaginal intercourse (A) may actually be harmful to patients with vaginal atrophy, as continuing to engage in intercourse usually helps prevent further tissue shrinkage. Recommending use of over-the-counter lubricants can aid patients in continuing coitus. Gabapentin taken nightly (D) will not benefit women with complaints of vaginal atrophy. This treatment would be more effective if the patient's post-menopausal symptoms manifested primarily as hot flushes. Oral conjugated estrogen preparations (C) are an inappropriate choice to manage this patient's symptoms due to the risks associated with using systemic, unopposed estrogen. In women with an intact uterus, estrogen should always be prescribed with an opposing progestin regimen to prevent endometrial hyperplasia and consequently endometrial carcinoma. A 58-year-old woman with no significant medical history presents for an annual wellness physical. She says it has been 16 months since she had any menstrual bleeding and notes moderate vaginal discomfort that makes coitus difficult for her. Which of the following recommendations would be most appropriate for this patient?Avoidance of vaginal intercoursePrescribe a vaginal ring containing estradiolPrescribe an oral conjugated estrogen preparationPrescribe gabapentin taken nightly Follicular cystCorpus luteum cysts (A) are less common than follicular cysts, but clinically more important. Clinically, corpora lutea are not termed corpus luteum cysts unless they are a minimum of 3 cm in diameter. Corpus luteum cysts may be associated with either normal endocrine function or prolonged secretion of progesterone. Corpus luteum cysts vary from being asymptomatic masses to those causing catastrophic and massive intraperitoneal bleeding associated with rupture. Dermoid cysts (B) are benign cystic tumors composed of mature cells. Benign teratomas such as dermoid tumors are among the most common ovarian neoplasms, but not the most common type of ovarian cyst. Theca lutein cysts (D) are the least common of the three types of physiologic ovarian cysts. Unlike corpus luteum cysts, theca lutein cysts are almost always bilateral and produce moderate to massive enlargement of the ovaries. What is the most frequent cystic structure found in the ovary?Corpus luteal cystDermoid cystFollicular cystTheca lutein cyst B) Functional ovarian cystmost ovarian enlargements (75%) are caused by functional ovarian cysts, which actually are not a result of neoplasia but rather represent anatomical variations of normal ovarian function. These cysts are commonly asymptomatic, being only discovered during routine examination. The remaining 25% is represented by the ovarian neoplasms, categorized by the cell line of origin: epithelial (most common overall), germ cell (most common in the reproductive years, with the most common type being a benign cystic teratoma (A), which is also known as a dermoid cyst) or stromal cell (D). Overall, 90% of ovarian neoplasms in the reproductive years are benign (C), but decreases to 75% in the postmenopausal years (i.e., 25% of all ovarian tumors in postmenopausal women are malignant). This 15% increased incidence of ovarian malignancy denotes the importance of palpable ovarian enlargement in the postmenopausal population. A 32-year-old woman with fluctuating menstrual intervals comes to your primary care clinic for a pelvic examination. She is not currently pregnant, but has had two normal pregnancies and healthy deliveries. During adnexal palpation, you notice that one ovary is appreciably larger than the other. In your discussion with the patient, you explain that this ovarian enlargement most likely represents which of the following conditions?A) Benign cystic teratomaB) Functional ovarian cystC) Ovarian carcinomaD) Stromal cell ovarian neoplasm Gram negative bacillusChancroid is a common sexually transmitted disease in developing nations, but is relatively rare in the United States. Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi, a gram negative bacillus, which has an incubation period of 4 to 10 days. Initially, a small pustule will form at the site of inoculation and progresses to multiple, painful ulcerations with sharply demarcated purulent bases.Chlamydia trachomatis is an obligate intracellular gram negative organism (C), the most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease in the United States, and the infectious cause of chlamydial infections. Chlamydia can cause Lymphogranuloma venereum, which manifest as painless genital ulcers and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy A 25-year-old sexually active woman presents to the Emergency Department with a complaint of painful vulvar ulcers and a swollen inguinal lymph node. She denies dysuria and vaginal discharge. Which of the following is most consistent with the description of the offending infectious organism? Gram negative bacillusGram negative diplococcusObligate intracellular gram negative organismSpirochete HyperthyroidismWhen considering irregular menses in a middle-aged woman, a clinician should remember there are conditions other than menopause which can be causative. In any woman with changes in menstruation, consider pregnancy, and obtain a human chorionic gonatropin (hCG) level. A woman over age 45 who presents with menstrual irregularities plus common menopausal symptoms (such as palpitations, hot flashes, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, as in the patient above), is more likely transitioning into menopause than presenting with a new endocrine disorder, and as such, no further diagnostic evaluation is recommended. For women under 45 years of age with menstrual irregularities, consider hyperthyroidism, especially if the patient also demonstrates mood changes and hot flash type symptoms, like sweating A 42-year-old woman presents for evaluation of irregular menses, associated with episodes of excessive daytime sweating and palpitations. She has not had a hysterectomy or oophorectomy. She is currently sexually active, although intercourse has been more uncomfortable lately. Which of the following disorders would you consider in this patient's differential diagnosis? HyperaldosteronismHyperprolactinemiaHyperthyroidism Hypokalemia What laboratory test can aid in the diagnosis of menopause in a woman who is status post hysterectomy? AzithromycinCiprofloxacin (B) is a quinolone which has not been shown to be effective against Chlamydia trachomatis. Penicillin (D) is used in the treatment of syphilis and is not used to treat chlamydia. Metronidazole (C) is used for the treatment of vaginal trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis, but is ineffective against Chlamydia. A 25-year-old woman presents to your clinic with concerns about sexually transmitted infections. She admits to unprotected sex with multiple partners. She is asymptomatic, but her last partner told her that he recently tested positive for chlamydia. The most appropriate next step is administration of which of the following?AzithromycinCiprofloxacinMetronidazolePenicillin Is azithromycin recommended in the treatment of pregnant women with chlamydia infection? Total abdominal hysterectomyStage I = involvement limited to uterusStage II = Extension to and involvement of the cervixStage IV = Distant spreadChemotherapy (A) with doxorubicin and cisplatin is associated with poor long-term remission. Recurrence rates are significantly decreased with the use of postoperative external beam radiation, while patient's with significant tumor bulk benefit from preoperative radiation. However, any radiation (B) is considered adjuvant therapy to surgical excision. Vaginal hysterectomy (C) is reserved for patients with stage I disease, especially if they cannot tolerate the rigors of abdominal surgery A 65-year-old patient is diagnosed with stage III endometrial adenocarcinoma. You decide to refer her to a gynecologic oncologist. She asks you to explain the ""best treatment available."" In your counseling, you discuss which of the following treatment options?A) ChemotherapyB) External beam radiationC) Partial vaginal hysterectomyD) Total abdominal hysterectomy What is the first-line therapy for recurrent endometrial carcinoma? C) Surgical removal is associated with a 25% to 30% rate of recurrenceUterine fibroids decrease in size during menopause (A) and enlarge early in pregnancy. Uterine fibroids are 2x more common in African American women (B) than in White women. Uterine fibroids are usually multiple in nature (D) rather than single Which of the following is true regarding uterine fibroids?A) Increase in size during menopause B) More common in White women than African American womenC) Surgical removal is associated with a 25% to 30% rate of recurrenceD) Typically occur as a single fib What is the most frequently occurring pelvic tumor in women? Primary amenorrhea Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (A) is defined as nonpathologic, excessive and noncyclic bleeding mainly due to anovulation.Secondary dysmenorrhea (C) is abnormal uterine bleeding associated with non-midline pelvic pain, which can be due to endometriosis, uterine fibroids or pelvic inflammatory disease. Sheehan's syndrome (D) is a rare cause of amenorrhea in the complicated postpartum setting, in which severe hemorrhage and/or hypotension results in pituitary gland necrosis. A 14-year-old woman presents to clinic with some frustration over never having a menstrual period. She is short in stature and has Tanner stage 2 breast development. As you begin a gynecological exam, you realize that you cannot pass a speculum into the vagina. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?Dysfunctional uterine bleedingPrimary amenorrhea Secondary dysmenorrheaSheehan's syndrome Breast and pelvic examination, pregnancy test, pelvic ultrasound and serum follicle-stimulating hormone. What is the initial work-up of a patient with primary amenorrhea? B) Category BCategory A (A) correlates with agents known to be safe. The FDA requires a relatively large amount of high-quality data on a pharmaceutical for it to be defined as Pregnancy Category A. As a result of this, the FDA allocates many drugs that would be considered Pregnancy Category A in other countries to Category B. Category C (C) correlates with agents that have possible adverse effects. Their use should be considered only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Category D (D) correlates with agents that have known fetal risks and should be used only in life-threatening emergencies where there is no alternative agent. Which U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) category is defined by the following: Animal reproduction studies have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.A) Category AB) Category BC) Category CD) Category D D) Levonorgestrel intrauterine device (Mirena)Progestin-only pills (D - Micronor) are most effective in women who are exclusively breastfeeding. They are not as effective in pregnancy prevention in other circumstances. Combined oral contraceptives (A) and the etonogestral/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring (B) contain estrogen and therefore would be contraindicated in this patient whom is taking antiepileptic drugs Estrogens and progestogens are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. Seizure meds induce cytochrome P450 3A4, leading to enhanced metabolism of either or both the estrogenic and progestogenic component of COC's, thereby reducing their efficacy. carbamazepine can markedly reduce levels of ethinyl estradiol when taken concurrently. A 23-year-old nulligravida comes to your office for contraception counseling. She has a seizure disorder that is well controlled on carbamazepine. She is a nonsmoker and has no other medical problems or complaints. She is currently in a relationship and does not want to get pregnant in the next several years. Which one of the following contraceptives is the most appropriate? A) Combined oral contraceptives (""The Pill""B) Etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring (NuvaRing)C) Levonorgestrel intrauterine device (Mirena)D) Progestin-only pills (Micronor) Adolescent females taking injectable depomedroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera®) for a duration of 2 or more years should be monitored for which side effect? D) Obstetrics consultation ""snowstorm"" or ""bag of grapes"" appearance"" = Hydatidiform mole or molar pregnancyThis patient presents with vaginal bleeding and an ultrasound consistent with a hydatidiform mole or molar pregnancy requiring obstetrics consultationMethotrexate (A) is used for the medical management of early ectopic pregnancies. CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (B) is unnecessary as the ultrasound confirms the diagnosis. Antibiotics (C) are unnecessary in the management of molar pregnancy. A 18-year-old G1P0 woman at 16-weeks presents with vaginal bleeding. She had no prenatal care. Vital signs are unremarkable and physical examination only reveals a small amount of blood in the vaginal vault. A transvaginal ultrasound is performed and shows a ""snowstorm"" or ""bag of grapes"" appearance. Which of the following managements is most likely indicated?A) Administer methotrexateB) CT scan of the abdomen and pelvisC) Intravenous antibioticsD) Obstetrics consultation - Preeclampsia/eclampsia, - pulmonary embolism of trophoblastic cells - hyperemesis gravidarum What are the most common complications of a molar pregnancy? D) Pelvic ultrasonographyDetermining the source of abnormal uterine bleeding is a difficult task when caring for gynecologic patients. This evaluation begins with a detailed history and physical followed by laboratory tests and pelvic ultrasoundIf a gynecologic source is suggested, endometrial biopsy (B), which can be accomplished via many different curette procedures, is then recommended. If the source of bleeding is still not found, hysteroscopy (C), which allows direct visualization of the uterine cavity, is then recommended. If the diagnosis is still unclear, the patient may be sent for dilatation and curettage (A). This procedure's sedation allows for muscular relaxation which may increase diagnostic yield. A 30-year-old woman presents with abnormal menstrual bleeding. Her history and physical are unrevealing. Other than laboratory testing, which of the following is the next best step in evaluating this patient?A) Dilatation and curettage B) Endometrial biopsyC) HysteroscopyD) Pelvic ultrasonography Urologic and rectal, as it is difficult for some women to localize bleeding from the vagina, urethra or anus. Which nongynecologic sources must be initially considered in any woman with abnormal uterine bleeding? Initiate screening mammography at age 50Screening mammography for women may start at age 40 (B) in individualized cases based on risk factors. Magnetic resonance imaging (A) is not recommended as a diagnostic tool in breast cancer screening since there is not enough evidence to support its use. Ultrasound (D) is not used as a screening tool in breast cancer screening. Women who have suspicious lesions on mammography are generally sent for ultrasound to better visualize the lesions and determine next steps. A previously healthy 35-year-old woman presents to your clinic with questions about breast cancer screening. She has no family history of breast cancer and wants to know when she should start screening. Per the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?Initiate screening magnetic resonance imaging at age 40Initiate screening mammography at age 40Initiate screening mammography at age 50Initiate screening ultrasound at age 50 At what age should breast cancer screening for women without risk factors stop? Discharge home with repeat beta hCG in 48 hoursThis ultrasound does not rule out the diagnosis of an ectopic pregnancy as an ectopic pregnancy can cause a decidual reaction in the uterus, which appears similar to an early gestational sac. The definitive ultrasound finding for an intrauterine pregnancy would be the presence of a yolk sac or fetal pole. It is expected that above the discriminatory hCG zone of 1500-2500 mIU, a definitive IUP should be identified. Patients with a beta hCG below the discriminatory zone without a definitive IUP can be managed conservatively with a repeat hCG level in 48 hours (the level should double every 48 hours) and repeat ultrasound.Rhogam (B & C) is recommended for patients who are Rh negative and have vaginal bleeding. If the mother is exposed to fetal blood, she may develop antibodies that threaten future pregnancies. This patient does not have vaginal bleeding and is Rh positive obviating the need for Rhogam A 26-year-old woman presents with abdominal cramping after a positive home pregnancy test. Her vitals are T 98.7°F, HR 94, BP 110/66, RR 18, oxygen saturation 97%. Her exam is unremarkable. Labs reveal a serum beta HCG of 1000 mIU and she is Rh positive. She states that the pregnancy is wanted.The transvaginal ultrasound shows an early gestational sac without a yolk sac or fetal pole within the uterus. Which of the following is appropriate management for this patient?Administer methotrexate Administer Rhogam and discharge home with repeat beta hCG in 48 hoursAdminister Rhogam and methotrexateDischarge home with repeat beta hCG in 48 hours Abruptio placentaeAbruptio placentae, also called placental abruption, is defined as a premature separation of a normally implanted placenta from the uterus. Similar to placenta previa, it too causes third trimester bleeding, however unlike placenta previa, it is associated with significant pain, fetal stress and maternal complications.Vasa previa (D) is a condition in which the umbilical cord attaches into the placental membranes instead of the central placental tissue. This abnormal attachment generates an errant vessel which lies between the cervical os and the fetus, leading to the possibility of rupture and fetal demise. A 16-year-old woman in her third trimester presents with acute onset of significant pelvic pain and blood per vagina. Thus far, her pregnancy has been normal. Her past medical history is significant for hypertension, asthma and recreational cocaine use. Examination reveals a tender, extremely tense uterus. Which of the following is the most like diagnosis?Abruptio placentaePreeclampsiaUterine atonyVasa previa Oxytocin-induced vaginal delivery. Cesarean delivery is reserved for significant maternal and fetal instability. What is the preferred method of delivery in a woman with placental abruption? Intrauterine fetal pole and yolk sacThe fetal pole is a mass of fetal cells separate from the yolk sac that first becomes apparent on transvaginal ultrasound just after the 6th week of gestation. Beta-hCG levels (A) increase at a predictable rate in the early stages of pregnancy. Levels of beta-hCG double every 2-3 days during the first 7-8 weeks of normal pregnancies. However, there are conditions other than an intrauterine pregnancy that can lead to significant elevations of beta-hCG, such as gestational trophoblastic disease and molar pregnancy. This disorder is characterized by proliferation of chorionic villi. The associated high level of beta-hCG often leads to hyperemesis. Identifying fetal heart activity (B) does not confirm an intrauterine pregnancy because an ectopic pregnancy can progress to have fetal activity. Only when fetal heart activity is detected within the gestational sac can the pregnancy be confirmed as intrauterine. A true gestational sac is identified on ultrasound by the double ring, also known as the double decidual sign, and confirms an intrauterine pregnancy. A single layer gestational sac (D), or pseudosac, is possible, which looks very similar to a true gestational sac. In this setting, there can still be an ectopic fetus. Therefore, most clinicians confirm an intrauterine pregnancy when a gestational sac with a fetal pole or yolk sac is present. Which of the following confirms an intrauterine pregnancy?Beta-hCG of 200,000Fetal heart activity Intrauterine fetal pole and yolk sacSingle layer intrauterine gestational sac D) MetronidazoleTreatment for BV is with metronidazole 500 mg PO BID or clindamycin 300 mg PO BID for 7 days. Alternatively, metronidazole and clindamycin can be prescribed as a vaginal suppository. Unlike with other sexually transmitted infections, treatment of the partner does not reduce the response rate or rate of recurrence.Azithromycin (A) is often used to treat Chlamydia trachomatis infections in cervicitis or urethritis. Ceftriaxone (B) is a 3rd generation cephalosporin that is active against Neisseria gonorrhoea. Doxycycline (C) treats C. trachomatis infections Which of the following drugs must be prescribed in a patient with cervicitis in whom bacterial vaginosis is also suspected? A) AzithromycinB) CeftriaxoneC) DoxycyclineD) Metronidazole B) This patient presents with non-life threatening abnormal vaginal bleeding (previously called dysfunctional uterine bleeding), which can initially be managed with combination oral contraceptives. DUB is typically split into anovulatory (90%) and ovulatory (10%). In patients with vaginal bleeding of childbearing age, the most important first step in diagnosis is to rule out pregnancy. After this, it is important to explore other causes including medications, genital tract pathology and systemic disease. Once these are excluded, a diagnosis of DUB can be reached.Dilation and curettage (A) is typically offered to patients with heavy vaginal bleeding evidenced by hemodynamic instability. A hysterectomy (C) is rarely needed in the treatment of DUB but is indicated for patients with heavy bleeding and hemodynamic instability in which conservative management fails. Intravenous estrogen therapy (D) is effective in stopping heavy bleeding, but is not considered first line therapy. A 32-year-old woman presents with vaginal bleeding for 2 weeks. She states she has about 1 pad of bleeding every 2-3 hours. Vital signs are stable and physical exam only reveals blood from the cervical os. The patient's hemoglobin is 12 g/dl and her pregnancy test is negative. What treatment is indicated for this patient? A) Admission for dilation and curettageB) Combination oral contraceptivesC) HysterectomyD) Intravenous estrogen therapy Anovulatory bleeding is caused by the failure of the corpus luteal cyst to form leading to absence of progesterone and unopposed estrogen stimulation on the endometrium. What is the underlying pathophysiology behind anovulatory bleeding? Word catheter is placed for four to six weeksA Bartholin's abscess occurs with infection of an obstructed Bartholin gland, a pea-sized mucous secreting gland located on each side of the labia minora in the 4 and 8 o'clock positions. When the duct that drains fluid from the gland becomes blocked, a mucous-filled cyst forms and eventually, if not drained, bacterial overgrowth occurs leading to an abscess. It is also possible to have a primary infection of the Bartholin gland itself. Most commonly, the causative organism is normal vaginal flora of which E. coli is most prevalent in cultures. All patients do not require antibiotics (A). Like other abscesses, if adequate drainage is obtained in the immunocompetent host, antibiotics are not necessary. Many gynecologists recommend antibiotic therapy if cellulitis is present. Gonorrhea and chlamydia (B) are not the most common causes. Together they are responsible for approximately 10% of these abscesses. Incision is not performed in the OR (C) unless there is larger infection requiring anesthesia for facilitation of the drainage. Patients with recurrent abscesses may need marsupialization performed in the OR but this is not during the acute infection A 22-year-old woman presents with pain and swelling to the vulva. On examination, you notice an area of swelling with induration and central fluctuance at the 8 o'clock position. Which of the following statements is true regarding this?All patients require antibioticsGonorrhea and chlamydia are the most common causesIncision should be performed in the operating roomWord catheter is placed for four to six weeks At what age should patients be referred to a gynecologist to rule out Bartholin gland cancer? D) Suction curetteColposcopy (A) utilizes illumination and magnification of the vulva, vagina and cervix to evaluate the presence of premalignant and malignant lesions of these structures, but does not evaluate the endometrial cavity. Dilation and curettage (B) is reserved for patients with difficult or nondiagnostic outpatient biopsies. The results of a Papanicolaou test (pap smear) (C) may suggest endometrial abnormalities, but are unreliable in diagnosing endometrial cancer. A postmenopausal woman presents with abnormal vaginal bleeding. You suspect endometrial malignancy, and refer the patient for further investigation. Which of the following modalities is ?A) ColposcopyB) Dilation and curettageC) Papanicolaou testD) Suction curette Medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera)History of migraines is a contraindication for estrogen use. Behavioral methods such as the withdrawal method and periodic abstinence (A) are not as effective as hormonal therapy and should not be used as first line pregnancy prevention. Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal (D) and etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal (B) more commonly known as the are combined estrogen-progesterone birth control methods and because of the estrogen, are both contraindicated in this patient. A 26-year-old woman presents for her annual exam and is inquiring about birth control. She is current on her immunizations and her last pap smear was 2 years ago. She is in a monogamous relationship with her boyfriend and does not have any immediate plans for pregnancy. She has a history of migraines with aura but does not require any prescription medication. Which of the following birth control methods is the best option for her?Behavioral methods such as the withdrawal method and periodic abstinenceEtonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginalMedroxyprogesterone acetateNorelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol transdermal EpithelialThe most common primary type of ovarian cancer is of epithelial cell origin (90%), followed by germ cell origin (<5%, but the most common type in women younger than 20 years of age), then stromal cell origin (<2%). The most common malignant epithelial cell ovarian tumor is a serous cystadenocarcinoma. Which of the following is the most common cell type of ovarian cancer?EpithelialGerm cellGranulosa cell Stromal DicloxacillinAztreonam (A) and Penicillin V (D) are antibiotics that do not properly cover staphylococcal infections. Although metronidazole (C) is a common treatment of many gynecologic conditions, its cidal properties are ineffective against Staphylococcus aureus. However, it should be administered if mastitis is associated with subareolar abscess and nipple retraction. You diagnose lactation mastitis in a postpartum 17-year-old woman. She is currently breast feeding her healthy newborn. She has no allergies. In addition to local ice packs and ibuprofen, which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?AztreonamDicloxacillinMetronidazolePenicillin V Which United States Food and Drug Administration category describes medications in which the safety of use by pregnant woman is unknown and the drug should not be used unless the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk to the fetus? Category ACategory BCategory CCategory D D) MethyldopaHydrochlorothiazide (A), and diuretics in general, are considered second-line agents. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, such as lisinopril (B) and angiotensin receptor blockers, such as losartan (C) are contraindicated in pregnancy because of toxic effects on the fetus. Which of the following medications is the preferred outpatient treatment of hypertension in pregnancy? A) HydrochlorothiazideB) LisinoprilC) LosartanD) Methyldopa OsteoporosisA hypoestrogenic patient can develop severe osteoporosis, leading to increased mortality due to femoral neck fractures. Hormone replacement therapy, with estrogen-progesterone combinations, helps to maintain normal bone density. Overall, the prognosis for patients with amenorrhea is good, provided that neoplastic sources have been excluded and hormone replacement therapy is considered. You are treating a patient for primary amenorrhea. Her diagnostic evaluation has determined that the etiology is primary ovarian failure. Which of the following disorders is this patient at risk for?Cluster headachesGastrointestinal bleedingMenorrhagiaOsteoporosis Endometriosis""3 Ds,"" dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and dyschezia, as well as abnormal uterine bleeding are among the well-recognized manifestations. With endometriosis, the uterus is often fixed and retroflexed in the pelvis. The palpable mass is an endometrioma or ""chocolate cyst."" Imaging is of limited value and is only useful in the presence of pelvic or adnexal mass. Ultimately, a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis is made only by histology of lesions removed at surgery. Functional ovarian cysts (B) occur from ovulation and form as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. They are usually not symptomatic. It is important to consider ovarian cancer in a patient with a pelvic mass however, ovarian cancer (C) usually occurs in older women over age 55 and patients are often asymptomatic until the disease is more advanced. With Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (D) the patient will have abdominal tenderness, adnexal tenderness, cervical motion tenderness and an elevated temperature. A 29-year-old woman presents with cyclic pelvic pain that has been increasing over the last 7 months. She complains of significant dysmenorrhea and dyspareunia. She uses condoms for birth control. On physical examination her uterus is retroverted and non-mobile, and she has a palpable adnexal mass on the left side. Her serum pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?EndometriosisFunctional ovarian cystOvarian cancer Pelvic inflammatory disease Blood volume increasesHemoglobin concentration increases (D) in pregnancy is incorrect. Hemoglobin concentration is decreased as pregnancy is associated with a dilutional anemia caused by the increase in plasma volume which is proportionately greater than red cell volume. Which of the following correctly describes physiologic changes that occur in pregnancy? Blood volume increasesFunctional residual capacity increasesGastrointestinal motility increases Hemoglobin concentration increases C) Preliminary screening is a blood glucose >130 one hour after a 50 gram glucose loadIn about 50% of women, GDM is reversible after pregnancy and does not inevitably evolve into type 2 diabetes (A). Asymptomatic type 1 and type 2 diabetes, or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults existing before pregnancy may become clinical and irreversible. Glitazones (B) might be effective in overcoming the insulin resistance of pregnancy but are contraindicated. Their mechanism of action as transcription factors is a theoretic risk for teratogenesis. Screening for gestational diabetes is performed at 24-28 weeks' gestation not at 32-36 weeks (D). Which of the following statements is true regarding gestational diabetes?A) Gestational diabetes eventually evolves into Type 2 diabetesB) Glitazones are the first line treatmentC) Preliminary screening is a blood glucose >130 one hour after a 50 gram glucose loadD) Screening is performed between 32 and 36 weeks Vaginal hysterectomyVaginal hysterectomy is associated with better outcomes and fewer complications than laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomy (A). Operative management of an enterocele with an anterior colporrhaphy (B), or a rectocele with a posterior colporrhaphy (C) is often performed at the time of operation for uterine prolapse after the patient has undergone a hysterectomy, but is not the surgical treatment for uterine prolapse Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for stage IV uterine prolapse in a 50-year-old woman with no medical problems and no previous surgical history?Abdominal hysterectomyAnterior colporrhaphyPosterior colporrhaphyVaginal hysterectomy A pessary, usually of the ring, Smith-Hodge, donut, cube, or inflatable variety. What medical treatment can be tried in stage I and II uterine prolapse prior to any surgical treatment? DoxycyclineCephalexin (A) and penicillin (D) are category B and considered safe in pregnancy. Ciprofloxacin (B) is category C, therefore any benefits must be weighed against any potential harms. Which of the following antimicrobials is considered category D in pregnancy? CephalexinCiprofloxacinDoxycyclinePenicillin What is the name for the fetal limb malformations caused by thalidomide? A) CA-125Desmin (B) is elevated in endometrial and muscle sarcomas. Inhibin (C) is increased in adrenocortical carcinoma, but also in stromal ovarian cancer, which is the least common of the three histological subtypes of ovarian cancer and not common in younger patients. The S-100 (D) protein biomarker is elevated in melanomas and sarcomasWhile ovarian cancer represents the fifth most common gynecologic malignancy, it carries the highest mortality of all such malignancies. Two thirds of patients have advanced disease upon diagnosis. The disease is usually widespread at presentation due to the ease of direct extension into the peritoneal cavity. Risk is decreased in anovulatory patients who take chronic oral contraceptive pills. A young woman has a significant family history of gynecologic malignancy. She refuses oophorectomy at this time. In addition to serial ultrasound screening, which of the following serum levels will you monitor? A) CA-125 B) DesminC) InhibinD) S-100 Which genetic mutations are strongly associated with familial ovarian cancer syndrome? She may have a vaginal foreign body; consider a nasal speculum to attempt visualization and removalChildren often fear parental disapproval of a vaginal foreign body placement. This often leads to a delay in diagnosis until secondary signs (such as vaginal bleeding, foul smelling discharge, or purulent drainage) are noted by parents. The physical exam is often quite difficult owing to patient anxiety, small anatomic size, and parental concerns about sexual or physical abuse. However, a thorough vaginal exam is indicated in patients with vaginal bleeding or discharge. Use of a nasal speculum, procedural sedation, or trained assistant (such as a child life specialist) may facilitate this exam. A 3-year-old girl presents to the ED with her mom and grandmother for evaluation of vaginal spotting. The child has no other complaints and specifically denies sexual abuse or trauma when questioned alone. After watching a news special on sexual abuse, mom is concerned that her daughter may have been sexually assaulted, despite no specific concern. The child is acting appropriately and there are no external lesions or signs of trauma. Internal pelvic exam is difficult due to the patient's age. Which of the following statements is true?Obtain a pelvic x-ray prior to attempting a physical examShe is the victim of abuse; do no further evaluation without a trained nurse present and contacting authoritiesShe may have a vaginal foreign body; consider a nasal speculum to attempt visualization and removalVaginitis is an unusual diagnosis in this age group Initiate screening at age 21 with cytology onlyHPV testing is not recommended in women under age 30 (A). Younger women are more likely to have transient HPV infections and testing at a young age leads to unnecessary colposcopies. Cervical cancer screening with cytology only (D) or co-testing with HPV (C) is not recommended in women under age 21 regardless of sexual activity. A 19-year-old sexually active woman presents to your office with questions about cervical cancer screening. She wants to know when she should start getting screened since she's been sexually active for two years. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?Initiate screening at age 21 with cytology and human papillomavirus testingInitiate screening at age 21 with cytology onlyInitiate screening now with cytology and human papillomavirus testingInitiate screening now with cytology only Surgical visualizationDefinitive diagnosis is surgical. Doppler ultrasound showing absence of flow within the ovary is highly specific, however, the presence of blood flow does not rule out ovarian torsion, as the ovary has a dual blood supply and may maintain blood flow even in the presence of torsion. The most common finding in ovarian torsion is an enlarged, edematous ovary. Treatment is immediate and emergent surgical intervention in order to salvage the ovary and prevent secondary adverse events such as hemorrhage, peritonitis, and adhesions. Due to its enlarged tubo-ovarian ligament length, the right ovary is the most common side of torsion. Presenting history will include sudden onset and severe, unilateral pelvic pain, commonly during strenuous activity, as well as nausea and vomiting A 30-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with left lower quadrant pain. The pain started suddenly while she was sleeping and is rated a 10/10 in severity. Which of the following tests will yield a definitive diagnosis of an ovarian torsion? Computed tomographyMagnetic resonance imagingSurgical visualizationUltrasound Use of local irritantsThis patient's differential diagnosis is most concordant with vulvitis or vaginitis. A main differentiator between the two is the presence of increased or abnormal appearing vaginal secretions. Age of menarche (A), family history of endometrial cancer (B), and prior deliveries (C), although important in a complete gynecologic history, would not help to differentiate the above two conditions. it is important to investigate the use of any local irritants, like deodorants, perfumes, soaps, fabric softeners, tight fitting sportswear (like runner's synthetic shorts) and scented or dyed toilet paper. Visual inspection of the vulva and vagina, as well as palpation of the pelvic structures, are important parts of the physical examination. A 23-year-old woman presents with vulvar itching and vaginal discharge. She is not currently sexually active, and does not use contraceptives. She works in an office, drinks 3 alcoholic beverages a week and recently took up long-distance running. Physical examination reveals a reddened vulva without surface ulcerations, the absence of lice or nits, normal appearing vaginal secretions and an unremarkable vaginal cavity. There is no adnexal tenderness. Which important item is missing from this patient's history?Age of menarcheFamily history of endometrial cancerPrior deliveriesUse of local irritants Treat her laceration as indicated, perform a beta-hCG quantitative level, and obtain a pelvic ultrasoundIn addition to caring for her laceration, the patient requires further workup of her pregnancy. A beta-hCG level should be obtained to correlate with her stated dates and to help identify an intrauterine pregnancy, miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, or molar pregnancy. A pelvic ultrasound should also be performed to evaluate for ectopic pregnancy, given the severity, prevalence, and difficulty of diagnosis without the ultrasound. A type and screen should also be obtained to determine her Rh status and the potential need for RhoGam administration. Delay of treatment is not necessary (A) in this patient. If her vital signs were unstable, then priority would be given to treating a life-threatening condition. The patient should not be discharged (D) without further investigation into her pregnancy-related complaints. Determining the beta-hCG level (B) alone is insufficient to investigate the state of her pregnancy and the cause of her vaginal bleeding. A 32-year-old woman 8 weeks pregnant by dates presents to the ED with a 2-cm laceration to her index finger sustained while she was cutting a tomato. On review of systems, she also notes 2 days of vaginal spotting and lower abdominal cramping. Vital signs are within normal limits. Physical exam is consistent with a simple 2-cm laceration. The pelvic exam reveals a closed os and no adnexal tenderness or masses. Which of the following statements best describes the next step in management?Delay treating her laceration until her pregnancy status is further clarifiedTreat her laceration as indicated, and perform a beta-hCG quantitative levelTreat her laceration as indicated, perform a beta-hCG quantitative level, and obtain a pelvic ultrasoundTreat her laceration as indicated, then discharge with outpatient obstetrical follow-up Fasting glucose less than 95 mg/dLUniversal screening for gestational diabetes is recommended between 24-28 weeks of gestation. Screening is a two-step process that initially involves a 50-gram oral glucose load and measurement of plasma glucose one hour later. If the plasma glucose is > 130-140 mg/dL, the 100-gram three-hour glucose tolerance test is recommended. Medical nutrition therapy, exercise, and insulin are first-line treatment options for gestational diabetes. The American Diabetes Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommended the following glucose targets: fasting blood glucose < 95 mg/dL, one-hour postprandial blood glucose level < 140 mg/dL, and two-hour postprandial blood glucose level < 120 mg/dL. A 30-year-old Gravida 2, Para 1 woman at 12 weeks of pregnancy presents for routine prenatal care. She has a history of gestational diabetes mellitus managed with diet alone during her previous pregnancy. She denies any episodes of hypoglycemia. Today, her fasting blood glucose is 145 mg/dL and her hemoglobin A1C is 7.5. Which of the following represents an ideal intrapartum glycemic target for this woman? Fasting glucose less than 110 mg/dLFasting glucose less than 95 mg/dLOne-hour postprandial glucose level less than 200 mg/dLTwo-hour postprandial glucose level less than 200 mg/dL D) Papanicolaou testRoutine screening for ovarian cancer by ultrasound (C), measurement of tumor markers, or pelvic exam is not recommended. The positive predictive value is low because of the low prevalence of ovarian cancer in the general population. The meningococcal vaccine (B) is only recommended for adults with asplenia, first-year college students living in dormitories or military personnel. Woman 50-74 years of age should receive a mammography (A) every two years for breast cancer screening. However, some women may require earlier screening based on patient context (family history, genetic make-up) and the benefits and harms should be discussed with the patient. Do not routinely screen women >75 years of age with mammography. A 25-year old woman presents to her primary care physician for a routine annual visit. Her last Papanicolaou test was three years ago. She smokes cigarettes and is sexually active. Her mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer at age 50. According to the current guidelines, which of the following should be offered to the patient?A) MammographyB) Meningococcal vaccineC) Ovarian ultrasoundD) Papanicolaou test No. The vaccine is made from one protein from the virus that cannot cause HPV infection or cancer. Can administration of the HPV vaccine cause cancer? A) Education on positioningTopical remedies such as hydrogel dressing (C) and tea bag compresses (D) may also be effective, although no one topical agent has been shown to be clearly superior, and none is as effective as education on positioning and latch-on. Areolar engorgement is treated by the manual expression (B) or pumping of milk to soften the areola and allow better latch-on.Nipple pain with breastfeeding is extremely common, with some studies reporting a prevalence of up to 96%. Preventing or alleviating nipple pain is important for comfort, but also for promoting breastfeeding in general. The best intervention for nipple pain is education on proper positioning and attachment of the infant. This position may be lying on her side on the hospital bed or sitting in a comfortable chair. The most common position involves cradling the infant next to the breast from which he or she will feed, with his or her head propped up by the mother's arm. The infant should be placed with his or her stomach flat against the mother's upper abdomen, in the same plane. A new first-time mother calls for advice on nipple pain with breastfeeding. She is 6 days post partum after an uncomplicated delivery. Which one of the following is most effective for reducing the pain?A) Education on positioningB) Expressed breast milkC) Hydrogel dressingD) Tea bag compresses B) Clindamycin IV + gentamicin IVThis patient presents with endometritis and should be treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and admitted to the hospital. Endometritis affects 1 in 20 vaginal deliveries and 1 in 10 cesarean sections. There are a number of associated risk factors including operative delivery, prolonged rupture of membranes, lack of prenatal care and frequent vaginal examinations. Endometritis is a polymicrobial infection with gram-positive cocci and gram-negative coliforms involved. Patients typically present with abdominal pain, fever and foul-smelling lochia or discharge. It commonly develops the second or third day post partum. Clindamycin IV and gentamicin IV are typically recommended. A 30-year-old woman presents with fever and abdominal pain. She is 3 days postpartum after cesarean section. Physical examination reveals lower abdominal tenderness to palpation and foul smelling vaginal discharge. What management is indicated?A) Ceftriaxone IM and Azithromycin POB) Clindamycin IV + gentamicin IVC) FluconazoleD) Metronidazole C) Vaginal estrogenOral estrogen (A) should be reserved for systemic menopausal symptoms other than vaginal dryness, such as hot flashes. Progesterone (B & D) is not used to improve the lubrication or elasticity of the vaginal epithelium. A postmenopausal patient of yours is diagnosed with atrophic vaginitis and dyspareunia. She denies other menopausal complaints. Vaginal lubricants and moisturizers are not helping to decrease her symptoms. Which of the following would be most appropriate to prescribe next?A) Oral estrogenB) Oral progesteroneC) Vaginal estrogenD) Vaginal progesterone A 19-year-old woman presents with lower abdominal pain for 5 days. You consider pelvic inflammatory disease as a diagnosis. Which of the following is a likely contributor for this condition?A) Age over 25 yearsB) Barrier contraceptionC) Multiple sexual partnersD) Pregnancy Tubo-ovarian abscess, infertility, ectopic pregnancy. B) OdorA common office test is the KOH ""whiff"" wet preparation test, in which a secretion sample is mixed with saline and 10-20% potassium hydroxide. The presence of a ""fishy"" amine odor represents a positive test, while the absence of this abnormal amine-like odor represents a negative result. Color (A) is visually inspected, pH (C) is tested via an indicator strip and viscosity (D) is evaluated by rubbing the secretion between the fingers. A 32-year-old woman presents with an increase in vaginal secretions. You decide to perform a potassium hydroxide wet preparation of a sample. This test evaluates which of the following secretion qualities?A) ColorB) OdorC) pHD) Viscosity C) Uterine atonyPostpartum hemorrhage is defined as a loss of > 500 mL of blood after delivery. An enlarged and ""boggy"" uterus is seen with uterine atony. If this is palpated, then vigorous uterine massage should be performed to help prevent atony. Cervical laceration (A) occurs in greater than half of all vaginal deliveries. Most of these are under 0.5 cm. Small lacerations, up to 2 cm, heal on their own without complication. A larger or deeper cervical laceration should be suspected if there is bleeding with a firm uterus. The cervix should be visualized completely after delivery to check for lacerations and if bleeding profusely should be surgically repaired. A retained placenta (B) is a rare cause of post-partum hemorrhage. The placenta should be thoroughly examined after delivery and if a piece is missing, the uterus should be explored and portions of the placenta that are retained should be removed. Uterine rupture (D) has a multitude of causes including previous uterine scarring from C-section or other uterine surgery, including surgeries involving the cervix. This is the most common cause of uterine rupture. The uterus can also rupture if overstimulated which can occur with the use of oxytocin induction or augmentation. The treatment is surgical and hysterectomy may be required if the rupture is life-threatening. Which of the following is the most common cause of post-partum hemorrhage?A) Laceration to the cervixB) Retained placentaC) Uterine atonyD) Uterine rupture B) Microscopic examinationInfective vaginitis is very likely given the above clinical description. In the initial evaluation of these symptoms, it is important to determine the causative agent. A KOH ""whiff"" test can be performed to detect the amine-like ""fishy"" odor of bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas vaginitis. However, direct microscopic examination of the discharge suspended in saline (termed wet preparation, or 'wet prep') will reliably establish the diagnosis, and subsequently direct proper therapy. A young woman presents with a complaint of ""stained underwear."" She reports that for the last three days she has noticed a malodorous, greenish discharge emanating from her ""groin."" You take a thorough history and perform a pelvic examination. Which of the following is the next best step in evaluating this complaint?A) Bacterial cultureB) Microscopic examinationC) Pelvic ultrasonographyD) Serum complete blood count and chemistries D) Thyroid-stimulating hormoneThyroid abnormalities, both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, can result in such mood symptoms. Although the initial laboratory evaluation of suspected premenstrual syndrome is limited, a serum thyroid-stimulating hormone level is recommended. Serum sex steroids (A) and gonadotropins (B) are similar in women with or without premenstrual syndrome. A woman with current regular menstrual cycles is unlikely to be pregnant, as such, a human chorionic gonadotropin (C) level is unrevealing. A 22-year-old woman with regular menstrual cycles presents with symptoms concordant with premenstrual syndrome. In evaluating the large differential of these symptoms, which of the following serum laboratory tests is recommended?A) EstrogenB) Follicle stimulating hormoneC) Human chorionic gonadotropinD) Thyroid-stimulating hormone C) Predominance of gram negative rods on gram stainImprovement on oral metronidazole (A) is characteristic of both bacterial vaginosis and trichmoniasis. Patients taking metronidazole should be cautioned about a disulfiram-like reaction if alcohol is consumed during a course of metronidazole. Multiple punctate hemorrhagic cervical lesions (B) describe the classic ""strawberry cervix"" that is associated with trichmoniasis. A vaginal pH of <4.5 is normal, but a more basic vaginal pH of 5.5 (D) is characteristic of both bacterial vaginosis and trichmoniasis. A 15-year-old girl complains of vaginal discharge over the past two weeks. She reports recently becoming sexually active but uses condoms consistently during intercourse. Which of the following favors a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis over trichmoniasis?A) Improvement on oral metronidazoleB) Multiple punctate hemorrhagic cervical lesionsC) Predominance of gram negative rods on gram stainD) Vaginal pH of 5.5 D) MetronidazoleAzithromycin (A) is macrolide that is not used in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. Ceftriaxone (B), a third-generation cephalosporin, is administered parenterally and not appropriate for outpatient therapy. Doxycyline (C) is used in combination with ceftriaxone to treat gonorrhea and chlamydia but has no role in the treatment for BV. A 16-year-old sexually active girl presents to your clinic with foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Examination of the vaginal fluid reveals clue cells. The vaginal pH is 5. Which of the following is the best course of treatment for this condition?A) AzithromycinB) CeftriaxoneC) DoxyclineD) Metronidazole What is the treatment of choice for primary syphilis infection? D) Transvaginal ultrasound (Endometrial Cancer)Transvaginal ultrasound is the to evaluate painless vaginal bleeding in a postmenopausal patient in order to rule out endometrial (uterine) carcinoma. Transvaginal ultrasonography is used to measure the endometrial thickness, which should be less than 5 mm in a healthy patient. Colposcopy (A) is not indicated given the patient's normal Papanikolaou smear. Hysteroscopy (B) should be performed in the operating room if an office endometrial biopsy is not obtainable. A repeat Papanikolaou smear (C) is used to diagnose cervical cancer but not endometrial cancer. This patient also has a history of negative smears in the past, including one only a year ago. A 58-year old postmenopausal woman presents with painless vaginal bleeding. Her last menses occurred 5 years ago. She reports that her Papanikolaou smears have always been normal; the last one was obtained a year ago. Which of the following is the next step in management?A) Colposcopy with endocervical curettageB) HysteroscopyC) Repeat Papanikolaou smearD) Transvaginal ultrasound D) Pelvic ultrasonographyDetermining the source of abnormal uterine bleeding is a difficult task when caring for gynecologic patients. This evaluation begins with a detailed history and physical followed by laboratory tests and pelvic ultrasound. Common initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, serum prolactin level, serum ß-hCG and serum thyroid stimulating hormone level. Pelvic ultrasonography may reveal uterine lining abnormalities, including irregularities, polyps, fibroids and masses. The results of the above will guide the clinician down a non-gynecologic versus gynecologic pathway. A 30-year-old woman presents with abnormal menstrual bleeding. Her history and physical are unrevealing. Other than laboratory testing, which of the following is the next best step in evaluating this patient?A) Dilatation and curettageB) Endometrial biopsyC) HysteroscopyD) Pelvic ultrasonography D) Microscopic evaluation of vaginal fluidPremature rupture of membranes (PROM) is the rupture of the fetal membranes before the onset of labor. In most cases, this occurs near term. When membrane rupture occurs before 37 weeks gestation, it is known as preterm PROM. It can lead to significant perinatal morbidity, including respiratory distress syndrome, neonatal sepsis, umbilical cord prolapse, placental abruption, and fetal death. The presence of amniotic fluid can be confirmed with nitrazine testing (a pH of 7.1-7.3 as opposed to a normal pH of 3.5-6.0), the presence of ferning on microscopic evaluation, or smear combustion (amniotic fluid turns white and crystalizes when flamed).Corticosteroids (A) can accelerate fetal lung maturation and are widely used in preterm labor. However, their routine use in PROM has not been established because rupture of the membranes also stimulates fetal lung development. Digital manipulation of the cervix (B) should be avoided because the incidence of infection increases with the number of examinations. Magnesium sulfate (C) inhibits calcium uptake by smooth muscle cells and is used as a tocolytic agent in preterm labor. However, it has not yet been established that this patient is in preterm labor and tocolysis should not be initiated at this time. In addition, any initiation of tocolysis should be coordinated with the receiving obstetrician. A 22-year-old woman at 36 weeks gestation presents with complaints of feeling a sudden gush of water coming from her vagina. She has had regular obstetrical follow-up and a normally progressing pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?A) Administration of corticosteroidsB) Immediate digital examination of the cervixC) Initiation of magnesium sulfate infusionD) Microscopic evaluation of vaginal fluid Chorioamnionitis, an inflammation of the fetal membranes (amnion and chorion) due to a bacterial infection. What infectious condition should all PROM patients be evaluated for? B) EstrogenDuring menopause, the ovary becomes less sensitive to circulating follicle-stimulating hormone, and as such, produces less estrogen. Estrogen is largely responsible for the health of the female urogenital epithelium, acting on receptors located in the vagina, vulva, urethra and urinary bladder. It maintains the proper amount of collagen, mucopolysaccharides and hyaluronic acid in the epithelium of these organs. As estrogen levels decrease significantly as a woman passes thru menopause, urogenital epithelial changes occur, and as a result, vaginal dryness and irritation can occur. The subsequent decrease in vaginal lubrication can cause painful sexual intercourse. Also, thinning and irritation of the urinary epithelium can lead to recurrent urinary tract infections. A postmenopausal woman presents to the clinic worried about her and her husband's sexual health. As of late, sexual intercourse has been very uncomfortable for the both of them. She thinks it has to do with her recurrent urinary tract infections, however, you explain that as a woman ages, vaginal atrophy occurs due to a significant decrease in which of the following hormones?A) AndrostenedioneB) EstrogenC) ProgesteroneD) Testosterone Increased follicle-stimulating hormone, decreased estrogens and decreased progesterone. What are the classic hormone level alterations in menopause? D) There is an increased risk for fetal demiseThis woman has classic symptoms of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. It is characterized by pruritus which is often concentrated in the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. Serum bile acids are almost always elevated and there is a significant increase in intrauterine fetal demise. A widely accepted management approach is induction of labor between 36 and 37 weeks gestation as most fetal deaths occur after 37 weeks. Aminotransferases are often elevated (A) in this disease. The treatment of choice is ursodiol which helps increase hepatic bile flow and decrease bile acid levels. This improves pruritus and also helps lower aminotransferase levels. Cholestyramine (C), which decreases absorption of bile salts in the ileum, is not as effective as ursodiol in decreasing pruritus. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy will recur (B) in over half of subsequent pregnancies. A 25-year-old G2P1 presents to your office at 32 weeks gestation with a complaint of severe itching, particularly on the palms of her hands and the soles of her feet. Lab results reveal elevated bile acids. Regarding this disease, which of the following statements is most correct?A) Aminotransferases are lowB) Disease recurrence is rare in subsequent pregnanciesC) The treatment of choice is cholestyramineD) There is an increased risk for fetal demise D) Polycystic ovary syndromeThe girl has signs and symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) that consists of ovulatory dysfunction or menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism such as hirsutism and acne. The evaluation for PCOS begins with a focused clinical evaluation for the presence of hirsutism and menstrual irregularity. Then, it is followed by laboratory testing for androgen excess by measuring total or free testosterone. Demonstration of hyperandrogenism in a patient with an abnormal degree of menstrual irregularity fulfills the diagnostic criteria for PCOS. Patients may further be evaluated with ovarian ultrasonography to rule out other causes of hyperandrogenism. PCOS would demonstrate polycystic ovaries either excessive size or follicle number (or both), in the absence of a dominant-size follicle (> 1.0 cc) or a corpus luteum. Management of PCOS involves treatment of individual components of the syndrome (hirsutism, oligomenorrhea, infertility, and obesity), depending upon the patient's goals. You are seeing a 16-year-old girl in clinic because of menstrual irregularity. She had menarche at 12 years of age and since then has had irregular menses that occur every 80 to 90 days. Her periods last for five to seven days with moderate amount of bleeding. She denies sexual activity. She does not report pain with menses and does not take any medication. She admits to shaving excess hair on her upper lip and chest. On examination, you note BMI of 30, severe acne on face, and Tanner 5 breasts and pubic hair. Her vital signs are normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) Abnormal uterine bleedingB) Anorexia nervosaC) Cushing syndromeD) Polycystic ovary syndrome D) MetronidazoleThe patient's presentation is consistent with bacterial vaginosis (BV), which is the most common cause of vaginitis. BV is not a sexually transmitted disease; rather, it is caused by a change in the vaginal flora with the replacement of Lactobacillus species with high concentrations of a polymicrobial group including anaerobic bacteria, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Mycoplasma hominis. It is also associated with an increase in vaginal pH from 4.5 to as high as 7. The pathognomonic finding for BV is clue cells, which are bacteria that line the borders of the vaginal epithelial cells. Diagnosis can also be made using the Amsel criteria (see table). The recommended treatment regimen includes 1 week of metronidazole or clindamycin, either orally or intravaginally. Azithromycin (A) and doxycycline (C) are indicated to treat chlamydia cervicitis. Ceftriaxone (B) or other 3rd-generation cephalosporins can be used to treat gonorrheal cervicitis. A 21-year-old woman presents with foul-smelling vaginal discharge for 5 days. Her urine pregnancy test is negative. On exam, she has no cervical or adnexal tenderness to palpation. A moderate amount of whitish-gray discharge is noted in the vault that you perform microscopy on, as seen above. What is the appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?A) AzithromycinB) CeftriaxoneC) DoxycyclineD) Metronidazole D) Repeat Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing in one yearAll patients should be counseled on safe sex practices (A) regardless of lab results. Patients with significantly abnormal cytology require further evaluation with repeat cytology and HPV testing or colposcopy (B). Negative cytology would not require immediate referral for colposcopy. For women aged 30 years and older, the recommendation for a Pap smear with negative cytology and negative HPV is repeat co-testing in five years (C). A 32-year-old woman presents to your office for a physical exam including a Papanicolaou test (Pap smear). Lab results reveal negative cytology and positive human papillomavirus (HPV). Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?A) Counsel patient on safe sex practicesB) Order colposcopyC) Repeat Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing in five yearsD) Repeat Pap smear and human papillomavirus testing in one year What are the two most common types of cervical cancer? D) Lactation mastitisThis condition may progress into or present initially as an abscess (A), a more defined and localized pocket of infection which is usually discretely palpable. Postpartum women who do not breast feed may experience symmetric breast engorgement (B) typically within 3 days post-delivery, but usually do not have the associated inflammatory symptoms as above. Although breast cancer (C) can present at many different ages, the patient's young age makes inflammatory cancer less likely. Furthermore, inflammatory breast cancer is associated with skin thickening and dimpling, as well as axillary lymphadenopathy. A blocked breast duct, inspissation, can mimic mastitis, but usually does not have an associated fever. A 23-year-old woman presents with concerns of tender breast enlargement. Two weeks ago, she gave birth to a healthy newborn, whom she currently breast feeds. Examination reveals general erythema, warmth and edema of the right breast. There are no superficial abnormalities, no palpable mass and no purulent nipple discharge is present. The left breast appears normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) Breast abscessB) Breast engorgementC) Inflammatory breast cancerD) Lactation mastitis Supportive bra, cold cabbage leaves, and ice packs. What is the treatment of tender breast engorgement in a non-breast feeding postpartum woman? A) Continue breastfeeding from both breastsMaternal mastitis is common during breastfeeding and is not a contraindication to continued breastfeeding. While the mother is on antibiotics, she should be instructed to continue to fully empty the breast with each feed.The mother should not be instructed to feed only from the contralateral breast (B), as the risk of transmission of infection from the affected breast is negligible. Pumping and discarding breast milk (D) is unnecessary. Finally, discontinuation of breastfeeding (C) is not recommended. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of the infant's life. A mother calls the office concerned that she was diagnosed with mastitis while she is still breastfeeding her 1-month-old infant. What is the most appropriate recommendation?A) Continue breastfeeding from both breastsB) Continue breastfeeding from the contralateral breastC) Discontinue breastfeeding, as exclusive breastfeeding is only recommended for one monthD) Pump and discard all breast milk until the mastitis is resolved Until it is no longer mutually desired by the mother and child. B) Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM once + doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 14 daysCeftriaxone and azithromycin (A) are used in the treatment of cervicitis or urethritis. Clindamycin (C) and metronidazole (D) are used in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A 23-year-old, sexually active woman, presents with abdominal pain. Vital signs are normal. Pelvic examination reveals cervical motion tenderness and adnexal tenderness. Which of the following treatments is most likely indicated?A) Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM once + azithromycin 1000 mg PO onceB) Ceftriaxone 250 mg IM once + doxycycline 100 mg PO BID for 14 daysC) Clindamycin 300 mg PO BID for 7 daysD) Metronidazole 500 mg PO BID for 7 days Perihepatitis associated with PID. It manifests as right upper quadrant pain and is seen in 10% of patients with PID. C) HysterosalpingogramAssessment of fallopian tube patency is by hysterosalpingography (first choice) or laparoscopy (if history strongly suggests prior tubal damage). Both CT scan (A) and pelvic ultrasound (D) will show the uterine and ovarian anatomy but neither test will determine fallopian tube patency which is integral in the work up of infertility. Dilatation and curettage (B) is used for the diagnosis and treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding and is not a diagnostic criteria for infertility.Initial laboratory testing for the female partner includes a CBC, urinalysis, STD screen, confirmation of rubella and varicella immunity, and Papanicolaou smear. Ovulation should be verified by urinary ovulation prediction kits that detect the LH surge, determination of the mid-luteal phase serum progesterone level (7 days before anticipated menses), or both. A 29-year-old woman has been trying to get pregnant for 7 years. A previous physical exam and lab work were all within normal limits. An ovulation kit confirms that she is ovulating. She has never been pregnant before and her fiancé has fathered 2 children and recently had a semen analysis that indicated normal functioning sperm. Which of the following is the most appropriate test of choice?A) CT scan of the pelvisB) Dilatation and curettageC) HysterosalpingogramD) Pelvic ultrasound A) ChorioamnionitisPelvic inflammatory disease (C) does not occur during this stage of pregnancy due to the mucous plug that seals the cervix. It may occur during the first trimester although it is quite rare. Beginning at 16 weeks, the membranes of the chorioamniotic sac adhere to the cervical os and are at risk for infection. Chorioamnionitis is an intra-amniotic infection of the chorion and amniotic layers of the amniotic sac. The placenta and fetal membranes may also be involved. It is caused by an ascending infection of normal vaginal flora. This is a clinical diagnosis and patients require intravenous antibiotics, most commonly ampicillin and gentamicin. A 21-year-old woman with no prenatal care presents for evaluation of lower abdominal pain and fever. She estimates that she is approximately 7.5 months pregnant. On questioning, she acknowledges intermittent pain for two days and a gush of fluid shortly after the pain began. Her temperature is 101.8°F. Physical examination is notable for purulent material in the vaginal vault. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) ChorioamnionitisB) EndometritisC) Pelvic inflammatory diseaseD) Urinary tract infection What is the definition of preterm or premature labor? A) Metoclopramide (Reglan)It is a centrally acting dopaminergic antagonist that is used in the treatment of nausea and vomiting.Prochlorperazine (B), promethazine (C), and trimethobenzamide (D) are all Category C agents. Prochlorperazine and promethazine are also dopamine antagonists. The mechanism of action for trimethobenzamide is not well understood. Ondansetron (trade name Zofran) another commonly prescribed antiemetic is also Category B. Which of the following medications is commonly used to treat hyperemesis gravidarum is considered Category B?A) Metoclopramide (Reglan)B) Prochlorperazine (Compazine)C) Promethazine (Phenergan)D) Trimethobenzamide (Tigan) B) Chandelier signPelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an acute infectious condition of the upper female genital tract that causes significant inflammation. The most common areas of infection include the uterus and fallopian tubes, although adjacent pelvic structures or areas in the abdomen may also be affected. Physical exam findings include cervical motion tenderness, also referred to as chandelier sign. Cervical or adnexal tenderness on bimanual exam is suggestive of PID and further workup including testing for the presence of Neisseria gonorrhea and Chlamydia trachomatis should be initiated. A 23-year-old woman presents to your office with complaints of pelvic pain and vaginal discharge. She admits to having recent unprotected intercourse with a new partner and her last menstrual period ended three days ago. Which of the following physical exam findings supports the likely diagnosis?A) Chadwick signB) Chandelier signC) Goodell's signD) Hegar's sign What syndrome can be seen when pelvic inflammatory disease spreads to the abdomen? A) Inevitable abortionThreatened abortion (D) is diagnosed when the pregnant woman presents with vaginal bleeding, lower back discomfort, or midline pelvic cramping. On examination, the cervix is closed, and the pregnancy is viable.Inevitable abortion is associated with painful abdominal cramps, vaginal bleeding and a dilated cervix with gestational tissue often visible at the cervical os or on ultrasound. Dilatation and curettage is indicated for significant cramping or blood loss. A 25-year-old woman presents to your office with amenorrhea, abdominal cramping, and irregular vaginal bleeding. She usually has monthly menstrual cycles, but has been intermittently spotting over the last 2 months. Her exam shows a firm uterus without tenderness and a dilated cervix with blood in the vaginal vault. Her beta HCG is positive and a bedside ultrasound reveals a yolk sac, fetal pole and no evidence of cardiac activity. What is the most likely diagnosis?A) Inevitable abortionB) Physiologic bleedingC) Septic abortionD) Threatened abortion B) MenorrhagiaAmenorrhea (A) is the absence of bleeding for > 3 cycles. Metrorrhagia (C) is light uterine bleeding at irregular intervals. Menometrorrhagia is heavy uterine bleeding at irregular intervals. Oligomenorrhea is regular bleeding which cycles at intervals > 35 days. Polymenorrhea (D) is regular bleeding which cycles at intervals < 21 days. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is a diagnosis of exclusion; refers to excessive, noncyclic bleeding which is mainly due to anovulation. Menorrhagia is excessive bleeding (> 80 mL per cycle) or menstruation > 7 days, which is mainly due to an anatomic or hemostatic abnormality. During the menstruation section of a gynecologic history, you determine that your 36-year-old patient's menstrual periods are increasing in length from four days to eight days, even though she still cycles every 28 days. She also reports more blood flow than typical during the first three days of these new eight day periods. Which of the following terms correctly defines this abnormal uterine bleeding?A) AmenorrheaB) MenorrhagiaC) MetrorrhagiaD) Polymenorrhea B) At the xiphoid processThe fundus is at the umbilicus (A) at 20 weeks; between the pubic symphysis and umbilicus (C) at 16 weeks; and between the umbilicus and xiphoid process (D) at 28 weeks. Where is the uterine fundus palpable at 36 weeks gestation?A) At the umbilicusB) At the xiphoid processC) Between the pubic symphysis and umbilicusD) Between the umbilicus and xiphoid process Approximate increase of 10 to 15 beats/minute in pregnancy. What is the average difference in resting heart rate in a pregnant woman vs. a nonpregnant woman? D) Placenta previaOne of the common causes of third trimester bleeding is placenta previa, in which the placenta improperly implants over or in close proximity to the cervical os due to abnormal vascularization. Risk factors include increased maternal age, multiparity, prior placenta previa and prior cesarean delivery. Incidence in nulliparas is about 1 in 1500, and increases to 1 in 20 in grandmultiparas. Bleeding, which is variable in amount and maternal in origin, typically presents in the 29th-30th gestational week. There typically is no pain associated with the bleeding. Diagnosis is made via ultrasonographic examination. Treatment consists of hospitalization, bed rest, hemodynamic stabilization if necessary and observation with expectant management until fetal maturity occurs (typically >36 weeks gestation). A 39-year-old woman in her third trimester presents with two days of bloody ""spotting"" on her underwear. This is her third pregnancy, which thus far has been uncomplicated. Her initial delivery was vaginal and her second delivery was via cesarean section. She is currently sexually active, and has a history of trichomoniasis. She denies pelvic pain. Laboratory examination reveals hematocrit of 32%, white blood cell count of 10,000, platelet count of 260,000 INR of 1.1 and aPTT of 32 seconds. Pelvic examination shows a nonerythematous cervix with clear mucus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) CervicitisB) HELLP syndromeC) Maternal coagulopathyD) Placenta previa The rate of congenital malformations (namely neurologic, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and respiratory) doubles with placenta previa. Other than peripartum hemorrhage, name a fetal complication of placenta previa. B) Start antibiotics and continue breastfeeding with either breastThis woman most likely has a breast abscess due to breastfeeding-associated lactation mastitis. The recommended treatment plan for breast abscess involves drainage and antibiotics. Drainage can be accomplished via small incision or needle aspiration. First-line antibiotic choices include dicloxacillin, cephalexin or clindamycin.Antibiotics (A and D) are recommended in breastfeeding-associated lactation mastitis. Breastfeeding (C) should continue. A breastfeeding 28-year-old woman presents for evaluation of a painful right breast ""lump"" three weeks after delivery of a healthy newborn. Examination reveals localized erythematous edema of the right breast, a 7/10 painfully palpable discrete induration and thick, yellow nipple discharge. The nipple and areola are not excoriated. The left breast is unremarkable. You refer the patient for a drainage procedure. In the meantime, which of the following is the most appropriate initial plan?A) Continue breastfeeding with the left breast only; antibiotics are not recommendedB) Start antibiotics and continue breastfeeding with either breastC) Start antibiotics and stop breastfeedingD) Stop breastfeeding; antibiotics are not recommended Cabergoline, whose dopamine agonism antagonizes the release of prolactin. Which medication can be considered to halt lactation in women with poorly controlled infection, severe symptoms, instability or wide spread nipple excoriation? D) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitorsTreatment of mild premenstrual syndrome symptoms, those considered to not alter daily socioeconomic function, includes stress reduction techniques and regular exercise. This patient reports historical points which reveal moderate to severe symptomatology. In women whose daily function is altered due to the cyclical, luteal phase symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are recommend as first-line therapy. Anticholinergics (A) block central and peripheral nervous system acetylcholine transmission. Their common side effects of confusion, irritability, dysphoria, memory difficulty and poor concentration would not be recommended in a patient who is already cognitively and vocationally impaired. Surgery, consisting of hysterectomy (B) with bilateral oophorectomy, is reserved for rare refractory cases of severe disabling premenstrual syndrome symptoms. Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) (C) are recommended as second line therapy in those women who cannot tolerate the side effects of, or do not respond to, SSRIs. A 24-year-old woman presents for initial evaluation of cyclical symptoms of irritability, painful bloating and depression. These symptoms occur regularly 4-5 days prior to the beginning of menstruation. During these few days, this patient typically has to miss work due to the ""awful pain and mental clouding."" Which of the following treatment options do you recommend as first-line therapy?A) AnticholinergicsB) HysterectomyC) Oral contraceptive pillsD) Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors What is considered third-line treatment of continued severe premenstrual symptoms in women who do not tolerate or respond to SSRIs or OCPs? C) Recommend ibuprofen starting one day before mensesRecommending acetaminophen (B) will not be as beneficial as ibuprofen since it does not directly affect the prostaglandins responsible for primary dysmenorrhea. Recommending oral ibuprofen starting one day before her menses is scheduled to begin typically provides modest relief for women with abdominal cramps due to primary dysmenorrhea. In the absence of a structural or infectious cause, this pain is caused primarily by uterine vasoconstriction, contractions, and anoxia brought on by prostaglandins present in the first few days of a menstrual cycle. As a result, NSAIDs are generally effective for reducing pain, as they are prostaglandin inhibitors. A 15-year-old girl presents for severe lower abdominal pain that occurs for the first two days of her menstrual cycle each month. She has associated nausea and diarrhea. She denies menorrhagia. She had a normal menarche at age 13 and is not sexually active. Abdominal and pelvic exams are normal. Which of the following is the initial best step in management?A) Obtain a Pap smear and cervical culturesB) Recommend acetaminophen starting one day before mensesC) Recommend ibuprofen starting one day before mensesD) Referral for exploratory laparotomy Applying local heat and taking oral vitamin E or thiamine have been shown to give some improvement in managing primary dysmenorrhea. What are some holistic therapies and supplements that have been shown to improve the pain of primary dysmenorrhea? A) Infiltrating ductalInfiltrating lobular carcinoma (B) is the second most common type of infiltrating breast carcinoma. This type of carcinoma tends to metastasize later than infiltrating ductal carcinomas and spread to more unusual locations. Medullary carcinoma (C) occurs more in younger women and makes up approximately 5% of all breast cancer cases. Papillary carcinoma (D) is one of the least common types of breast cancer, making up 1% of cases. It is most commonly found in women older than 65 years. Which of the following is the most common type of invasive breast cancer in women? A) Infiltrating ductalB) Infiltrating lobularC) MedullaryD) Papillary What is the most common type of breast cancer among men? C) Initiate screening mammography at age 50Screening guidelines for cancer are developed after consideration of a number of factors including the benefits and harms of screening, scientific evidence of the risks of the condition and cost. Guidelines for breast cancer screening have more scientific evidence than any other type of cancer screening and have changed in recent years. There remain some discrepancies between different medical groups regarding recommendations for screening. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening mammography for women every two years from ages 50-74 years. Earlier and more frequent screenings may be individualized based on patient risk factors such as family history of breast cancer. A previously healthy 35-year-old woman presents to your clinic with questions about breast cancer screening. She has no family history of breast cancer and wants to know when she should start screening. Per the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Initiate screening magnetic resonance imaging at age 40B) Initiate screening mammography at age 40C) Initiate screening mammography at age 50D) Initiate screening ultrasound at age 50 C) Placental abruptionCigarette smoking during pregnancy is the most important modifiable risk factor associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Smoking and secondhand smoke exposure increase the risk of infertility, placental abruption, preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and placenta previa. Cigarette smoking also increases the risk of placental abruption. Dose-response curve analysis has consistently revealed that the risk of abruption is greatest among heavy smokers. Because PPROM is associated with both cigarette smoking and placental abruption, the relationship between cigarette smoking and abruption may be partially explained by the increased risk of PPROM. However, cigarette smoking appears to be a risk factor for placental abruption, independent of PPROM. Cigarette smoking has also been consistently associated with placenta previa. It is recommended that all pregnant women should be asked regularly about tobacco use. In clinical practice, screening for tobacco use is done by asking the patient if she has ever smoked cigarettes, if she smoked when she found out that she was pregnant, and whether she smokes now. Women who smoke should be asked the number of cigarettes smoked per day. A 17-year-old girl is examined for a routine visit. She eats a healthy diet. She also stays active by playing volleyball three times a week. Her grades are mostly B's. She admits that she started to be sexually active for the past six months and has delayed periods for two months now. She had her menarche at 12 years old and has regular periods. She also smokes a quarter of a pack of cigarettes per day. Which of the following is an adverse pregnancy outcome due to maternal smoking?A) HyperbilirubinemiaB) Large for gestational ageC) Placental abruptionD) Respiratory distress syndrome What is the effect of cigarette smoking on breastfeeding? A) Alpha-methyldopa (Aldomet®)The use of ACE inhibitors (B) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists (C and D) in late pregnancy has been associated with renal dysfunction, oligohydramnios, neonatal anuria, and other congenital anomalies such as skull ossification defects. However, data have also suggested an increased risk of congenital anomaly after exposure limited to the first trimester of pregnancy.Alpha-methyldopa is a centrally acting alpha-adrenergic medication used as a first line antihypertensive agent for pregnant women. If adequate control cannot be obtained, a second drug, most often nifedipine or hydralazine, can be added. Labetalol is gaining popularity for use as first-line single-agent therapy, but may be associated with fetal growth restriction. Which of the following is recommended to use as an anti-hypertensive in a pregnant woman?A) Alpha-methyldopa (Aldomet®)B) Lisinopril (Zestril®)C) Losartan (Cozaar®)D) Valsartan (Diovan®) What percentage of women with preexisting hypertension develops preeclampsia during pregnancy? C) Provide her with reassuranceAdvising her to stop using tampons (A) is not needed since tampon use would not affect her vaginal discharge. The girl's vaginal discharge is physiologic leukorrhea and therefore she should be reassured that this is normal. Normal vaginal discharge is composed of 1 to 4 ml fluid per day that is white or transparent, thick or thin, and usually odorless. The pH of normal vaginal secretions is 4.0 to 4.5. This is formed by mucoid endocervical secretions in combination with sloughing of epithelial cells and normal vaginal flora. The discharge may become more noticeable during the middle of menstrual cycle, during pregnancy, or with the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives. The normal discharge may be yellowish, slightly malodorous, accompanied by mild irritative symptoms, but it is not accompanied by pruritus, pain, burning, erythema, or local erosion. The absence of these signs and symptoms distinguishes it from pathologic discharge like vaginitis or cervicitis. In the clinic, you are evaluating a 15-year-old girl who is complaining of increased vaginal discharge. She had her menarche at 12 years of age and since then has had irregular periods. She uses tampons during her menses. She notes thick yellowish vaginal discharge in between her periods. She denies burning, pain, or pruritus. She started to be sexually active for the past month with one partner. She uses condoms for contraception. On examination, you note Tanner 5 pubic hair and white discharge. You examine the discharge and obtain pH of 4, with negative whiff test and absence of clue cells on microscopy. You perform a pregnancy test, which is negative. Which of the following is the next best step?A) Advise her to stop using tamponsB) Encourage her to douche after her periodC) Provide her with reassuranceD) Send culture for Gardnerella vaginalis What is the most common finding on microscopy for bacterial vaginosis? B) Placenta previaPainless third-trimester bleeding was a common presentation for placenta previa in the past; however, now most cases of placenta previa are detected antenatally with ultrasound before the onset of significant bleeding. This patient has had no prenatal care and is at increased risk for complications. Placenta previa is characterized by placental tissue that overlies or is adjacent to the cervical os. Placenta previa typically presents as painless vaginal bleeding in the second or third trimester. Between 70% and 80% of patients with placenta previa will have at least one bleeding episode. Patients at risk of placenta previa include increasing parity or maternal age, cigarette smoking, and prior uterine surgery. About 10% to 20% of patients present with uterine contractions before bleeding, and fewer than 10% remain asymptomatic. Of patients with bleeding, one third will present before 30 weeks' gestation, one third between 30 and 36 weeks' gestation, and one third after 36 weeks' gestation. Patients with early-onset bleeding (<30 weeks' gestation) have the greatest risk for blood transfusion and associated perinatal morbidity and mortality. The bleeding is believed to occur from disruption of placental blood vessels in association with the development and thinning of the lower uterine segment. Patients with placenta previa who present preterm with vaginal bleeding require hospitalization and immediate evaluation to assess maternal-fetal stability. In at least 50% of women who present with asymptomatic previa, delivery can be delayed for more than 4 weeks, including patients with initial bleeding episodes greater than 500 mL. A 39-year-old woman presents to the office with painless vaginal bleeding in the third trimester (32 weeks) of pregnancy. She has had no prenatal care and a history of tobacco use. She denies any lower extremity edema, and her vital signs are normal. She has five other children, all of whom were delivered via Cesarean section. Which of the following conditions should you be most concerned about?A) LaborB) Placenta previaC) Placental abruptionD) Preclampsia No, Cesarean delivery is indicated for all patients with sonographic evidence of complete placenta previa. Can a woman with complete placenta previa undergo a vaginal delievery? A) Atrophic vaginitisIt is unlikely that a patient with a normal temperature and absence of vaginal discharge has any of the common vaginal infections, including bacterial vaginosis (B) and candidiasis (C). Vulvar lichen planus (D) commonly occurs in postmenopausal women, but manifests as an erosive dermatitis associated with intense pruritus, burning and vulvar pain.Menopause can be defined as amenorrhea for greater than 12 months. Atrophic vaginitis, also referred to as urogenital atrophy, is a major cause of vaginal dryness in postmenopausal women, occurring in about 40% of this population. The generalized loss of estrogens, which is the hallmark hormone alteration associated with menopause, causes thinning of the urogenital epithelium. Vaginal dryness ensues, as well as burning, pruritus, discharge, bleeding and possibly dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse subsequent to decreased vaginal lubrication). A 54-year-old woman, whose last menstrual period was more than 2 years ago, complains of vaginal dryness and irritation. She denies any recent infection or sexual activity. She is afebrile with normal vital signs. Visual inspection of the vaginal canal reveals pale, dry and shiny epithelium without frank discharge or superficial lesions. Which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?A) Atrophic vaginitisB) Bacterial vaginosisC) CandidiasisD) Vulvar lichen planus Urinary frequency, dysuria and recurrent infections. What urinary symptoms typically accompany the vaginal symptoms of atrophic vaginitis? D) Squamous cell carcinomaCervical cancer is the third most common gynecologic cancer in the United States with a lower rate of incidence and mortality than ovarian or uterine cancer. Rates are lower because of the use of Papanicoloau (Pap) screening which allows for detection of pre-cancerous and early-stage disease. Countries worldwide without access to cervical cancer screening have rates of cervical cancer that are much higher than the United States, with cervical cancer remaining the second most common type of cancer in women worldwide. Human papillomavirus is found in more than 99% of all cervical cancers and causes the development of cervical neoplasia. Risk factors for cervical cancer include activities that lead to infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), oral contraceptive use and cigarette smoking. The most common type of cervical cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, which is found in 69% of cases of cervical cancer in the United States. Which of the following is the most common type of cervical cancer?A) AdenocarcinomaB) Cervical sarcomaC) Small cell carcinomaD) Squamous cell carcinoma C) Oral ibuprofenThis patient's working diagnosis is most concordant with primary dysmenorrhea, in which there is significant pain associated with the first few days of menses which alters normal activity or requires pain medication to control. Although secondary causes such as endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease are the most common misdiagnosis of primary dysmenorrhea, her stable presentation in this specialized setting, in conjunction with a normal initial diagnostic test, favors symptomatic control and follow-up evaluation. To treat dysmenorrhea, non-steroidal antiinflammatory medications (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen are helpful.Opioid analgesics (A) are considered second line if NSAIDs and acetaminophen fail to relieve the pain. Consider parenteral pain control if oral medications fail. Abdominopelvic heat is also beneficial. A 30-year-old woman misses work and presents to the Emergency Department with severe pelvic pain rated at 6/10. She states it began yesterday with the onset of menstruation. She has regular cycles with normal blood flow amount, but has not had this pain before. She denies spine, urologic and rectal symptoms. Vital signs are normal, and physical examination as well as pelvic ultrasound is unremarkable. Serum beta-hCG is negative. Other than referral to a gynecologist for further evaluation, which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?A) Intravenous morphineB) Oral contraceptive pillsC) Oral ibuprofenD) Oral pregabalin Their antiprostaglandin action counters the underlying pathophysiology. C) Pelvic ultrasoundThis patient presents with a history concerning for ovarian torsion and should undergo a pelvic ultrasound. Ovarian torsion is an organ threatening disease, involving twisting of the ovary or fallopian tube or both on the vascular pedicle. It is more commonly seen on the right side (due to the effects of the sigmoid colon being on the left) and in women of childbearing age. Patients typically present with sharp, severe unilateral abdominal pain with nausea or vomiting. However, the classic presentation is often not present making diagnosis challenging. Risk factors for torsion include the presence of an ovarian mass or infertility treatment. Clinicians must maintain a high suspicion for this disease in order to make a timely diagnosis and prevent ovarian necrosis. Pelvic ultrasound, while imperfect, represents the best initial imaging modality. The classic ultrasound appearance in torsion is enlargement with a heterogenous stroma and peripherally displaced follicles. The most common findings are an increased ovarian size and an abnormal position in relation to the uterus. The addition of Doppler ultrasound may demonstrate decreased blood flow to the ovary but these findings are inconsistent. Additionally, Doppler ultrasound may be completely normal in intermittent torsion. Ultimately, patients with suspected ovarian torsion may require laparoscopy to confirm or rule out torsion. A 15-year-old G1P0 woman at 23 weeks presents with sharp, left lower quadrant abdominal pain for 1 hour. She has had an ultrasound confirming the presence of a single intrauterine pregnancy. The pain is severe and associated with nausea. Pelvic examination reveals tenderness of the left adnexa. The patient's urinalysis is unremarkable. What test should be ordered to diagnose the patient?A) Abdominal X-rayB) CT scan of the abdomen and pelvisC) Pelvic ultrasoundD) White blood cell count It is believed that the sigmoid colon stabilizes the left ovary so that it is less likely to torse. Why is ovarian torsion more common on the right side? A) Consult Obstetrics and GynecologyEctopic pregnancy is a life-threatening illness that must be considered in all women of childbearing age who present with abdominal pain, pelvic pain, abnormal vaginal bleeding, amenorrhea, or evidence of unexplained hypovolemia. Until pregnancy is ruled out or a uterine pregnancy is confirmed, ectopic pregnancy should remain high on the differential. An ectopic pregnancy is any pregnancy that implants outside of the uterine cavity. The vast majority of ectopic implantations occur in the fallopian tubes, although abdominal, cervical, and cesarean scar pregnancies can occur. Diagnosis is confirmed by a positive hCG test (either urine or serum) and evidence of implantation outside the uterus (either by ultrasound, laparoscopically or surgically). A positive pregnancy test with an unknown location of implantation does not confirm the diagnosis, but whenever an intrauterine pregnancy cannot be confirmed, ectopic implantation should be considered. Due to the life-threatening nature of the illness, any hypotensive patient with strong suspicion for an ectopic pregnancy warrants an emergent consult to Obstetrics and Gynecology for possible operative management. Although obtaining a complete blood count (B), serum human chorionic gonadotropin levels (C), and a pelvic ultrasound (D) can aid in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy, in an unstable patient with high suspicion for ectopic pregnancy, these diagnostic tests should not delay mobilization of resources that can provide definitive care. A 26-year-old previously healthy woman presents to the Emergency Department with abdominal pain. She was at home when she developed sudden onset lower abdominal pain followed by a brief syncopal episode. Her vital signs include blood pressure of 88/46 mm Hg, heart rate of 112 beats/minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/minute, temperature of 37.6°C, and oxygen saturation of 98%. She had a positive home pregnancy test yesterday. After initiating aggressive resuscitation, what is the most appropriate next step in management? A) Consult Obstetrics and GynecologyB) Obtain a complete blood countC) Obtain a serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levelD) Pelvic ultrasound MethotrexateDestroys trophoblastic tissue (disrupts cell multiplication)CI: ruptured ectopic pregancy, h/o TB, beta-hCG >5,000, + fetal heart tones, noncompliant patient. In a hemodynamically stable pregnant patient with an ectopic pregnancy, what medication is recommended for medical management? C) HydralazineMagnesium sulfate (D) is used for seizure prevention in preeclampsia and for the treatment of eclampsia, but it is not specifically an antihypertensive. The patient has severe preeclampsia. Preeclampsia refers to the constellation of hypertension after 20 weeks of pregnancy (blood pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 90 mm Hg diastolic) plus proteinuria (> 0.3 g in a 24-hour collection period). Severe preeclampsia refers to marked hypertension with evidence of end-organ dysfunction. Diagnostic criteria include two or more of the following: blood pressure ≥ 160 mm Hg systolic or ≥ 110 mm Hg diastolic (measured on two occasions at least four to six hours apart), visual disturbances, mental status changes, pulmonary edema, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, elevated liver function tests, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, oliguria, or impaired fetal growth. If a patient with preeclampsia develops seizures, it is termed eclampsia. Delivery of the infant is the definitive treatment. Mild preeclampsia can be monitored without treatment, but severe preeclampsia should be treated with antihypertensives and magnesium for seizure prevention until delivery can be safely achieved. Antihypertensives of choice for severe preeclampsia include intravenous labetalol, hydralazine, and nifedipine. Patients presenting to the ED with signs and symptoms of preeclampsia should always be co-managed with an obstetric consultant. A 21-year-old woman G1P0 at 35 weeks gestation presents with headache, blurry vision, and shortness of breath. Vital signs include a blood pressure of 195/110 mm Hg, heart rate of 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 21 breaths per minute, oral temperature of 37.1℃, and oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Urinalysis reveals 3+ protein. A chest radiograph reveals pulmonary edema. Which of the following medications should be administered to reduce blood pressure?A) EnoxaparinB) FurosemideC) HydralazineD) Magnesium sulfate B) Begin intravenous antibiotics and admit for possible drainageA tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA) typically results as a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and is most commonly seen in sexually active women. Since it is a complication of PID, patients typically present with lower abdominal and pelvic pain, fever, vaginal discharge, and cervical motion or adnexal tenderness. Pelvic exam may reveal a palpable mass in the adnexa. Ultrasound is the test of choice for suspected TOA, and transvaginal is best for visualizing the adnexa. Ultrasound findings typically include identification of a complex cystic, thick-walled, well-defined mass in the adnexa or retrouterine area. The mass is usually multiloculated with air-fluid levels. If ultrasound is equivocal, a CT scan can aid in the diagnosis. Treatment involves administration of intravenous antibiotics. Some abscesses require surgical drainage. Tubo-ovarian abscesses can result in irreversible tubal and ovarian damage and pose a serious threat to fertility. Although ceftriaxone and doxycycline (A) is the treatment for PID, patients with a TOA require a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotics and possible surgical drainage. This requires inpatient management. A 32-year-old woman presents with fever and lower abdominal pain. She has a history of pelvic inflammatory disease. Her vitals are T 38.4°C, HR 133, and BP 101/60. On examination, the patient is toxic appearing and has marked lower abdominal tenderness to palpation with rebound and guarding. Pelvic examination reveals cervical motion tenderness, scant discharge, and left adnexal tenderness. The patient's urine beta-hCG is negative. A transvaginal ultrasound is performed and reveals a complex cystic, thick-walled, well-defined mass in the left adnexa. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?A) Administer ceftriaxone and discharge home with a 14-day course of doxycyclineB) Begin intravenous antibiotics and admit for possible drainageC) Obtain a CT scan to rule out appendicitisD) Send a serum beta-hCG to rule out ectopic pregnancy Infection is often polymicrobial and can include E. Coli, aerobic streptococci, and Bacteroides. Which organisms are commonly found in tubo-ovarian abscesses? A) A single dose of 150 mg fluconazoleBoric acid (B) and topical nystatin (D) are used in women who have complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis and who are allergic to fluconazole. Complicated infections are defined as having severe signs or symptoms, the presence of a candida species other than Candida albicans, or in women with a history of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis infections, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, or immunosuppression. Metronidazole (C) is used in the treatment of bacterial vaginosis. A 25-year-old woman with a recent history of antibiotic use presents to your office with a complaint of vaginal discomfort. For the past week she has been experiencing intense vaginal pruritus and has noticed a white discharge. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in her management?A) A single dose of 150 mg fluconazoleB) Boric acid intravagina for seven daysC) Metronidazole 500 mg twice/day for seven daysD) Topical nystatin 100,000 units daily for seven days Examination of vaginal discharge for fishy odor and pH along with microscopy What diagnostic studies are used in women with symptoms of vaginitis? A) Anger and irritabilityConfusion and other cognitive changes (B), mood swings and other mood changes (C), and serotonin dysfunction (D) are all associated with premenstrual syndrome. The presence of prominent anger, irritability and internal tension in combination with premenstrual symptoms differentiates premenstrual dysphoric disorder from premenstrual syndrome. According to the American Psychiatric Association DSM-IV, prominent anger, irritability and internal tension associated with severe premenstrual syndrome symptoms is defined as premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The presence of which of the following best differentiates premenstrual dysphoric disorder from premenstrual syndrome?A) Anger and irritabilityB) Confusion and other cognitive changesC) Mood swings and other mood changesD) Serotonin dysfunction The disabling symptoms of premenstrual syndrome mentally or physically incapacitate what percentage of affected women? Vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation with an open internal osApproximately 80% of miscarriages occur during the first trimester; the rest occur before 20 weeks of gestation or when the fetus is <500 g, considered premature birth. Approximately 25% of pregnant patients experience bleeding. Approximately 50% of all women who have bleeding during early pregnancy miscarry. Those with a history of bleeding who do not miscarry have otherwise fairly normal pregnancies, although they have an increased risk of premature birth and low-birth-weight infants. The 2 major causes of miscarriage are uterine malformations and chromosomal abnormalities. There are several stages of miscarriages. An inevitable abortion is defined by vaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation with an open internal os and no passage of placental or fetal parts. Which of the following best describes an inevitable abortion?Parts of the product of conception have been passed and may be visible in the cervical os or the vaginal canalRetention of a nonviable intrauterine pregnancy within the uterus, no cardiac activity, and a closed cervical osVaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation with a closed internal cervical osVaginal bleeding before 20 weeks of gestation with an open internal os C) Serum prolactin levelIn the absence of other breast signs or symptoms, breast imaging such as ultrasonography of the breasts (D) is not necessary. A brain MRI focusing on the pituitary sella is not needed until the diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia is confirmed. A MRI of the sella turcica (B) would be warranted if the prolactin level is elevated. Dynamic tests of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, such as a dexamethasone suppression test (A), are generally not indicated in the evaluation of amenorrhea. Dexamethasone suppression tests are indicated in disorders of glucocorticoid excess. A 26-year-old woman reports a history of amenorrhea for the past year. She also had an increased amount of milky discharge from her nipples over the past several months and has lost all interest in sex for the past 6 months. She denies any drug or medication use other than occasional over-the-counter analgesics for frequent headaches. A physical examination confirms the presence of an easily expressed milky discharge, as well as vaginal dryness. A pregnancy test is negative. Which one of the following tests would be most appropriate at this point?A) Dexamethasone suppression testB) MRI of the sella turcicaC) Serum prolactin levelD) Ultrasonography of the breasts What is the medication of choice for the treatment of prolactinoma? D) Urine beta-hCGAll women of childbearing age presenting with pelvic complaints require a pregnancy test. Even though this patient reports that she had her menses one week prior to her presentation, ectopic pregnancy and even a normal pregnancy can be associated with vaginal bleeding that can be mistaken for normal menses. Since ectopic pregnancy is a life-threatening condition, it is important to rule it out early in this patient's workup. A urine beta-hCG is a rapid test that has a very high sensitivity that can rapidly determine if a woman is pregnant. A negative urine beta-hCG effectively rules out ectopic pregnancy.A urinalysis (C) may also be helpful in the evaluation of a woman with pelvic pain, however, it is not entirely specific to the cause of pain. Urine may be affected by other diagnoses including cervicitis, vaginitis, pelvic inflammatory disease, nephrolithiasis, or appendicitis. A 23-year-old woman presents with pain in in the suprapubic area and right lower quadrant of her abdomen that began 4 hours ago. She denies vaginal discharge and vaginal bleeding. Her vital signs are BP 115/65, HR 60, RR 12, and T98.1°F. Her last menses was one week ago. Which of the following diagnostic tests should be obtained first?A) Complete blood countB) Gonorrhea and chlamydia DNA amplificationC) UrinalysisD) Urine beta-hCG Trichomonas vaginalis, a flagellated protozoan visualized on the wet mount causing an itchy, malodorous vaginal discharge. What organism may be identified by a wet mount made from a vaginal swab? A) Cesarean sectionInternal fetal monitoring (B), multiple gestation (C), and premature rupture of membranes (D) also increase the risk for endometritis but are less common than cesarean delivery. Other risk factors include young maternal age, maternal HIV infection, and lower socioeconomic class.Postpartum endometritis is the most common puerperal infection, usually developing on the 2nd or 3rd day postpartum. Typically, the lochia has a foul odor, and the patient develops a leukocytosis. The infection begins in the endometrium and can extend to the myometrium or parametrium. It is a serious infection that can lead to complications such as peritonitis, septic thrombophlebitis, and necrotizing fasciitis. The pathogens involved are typically the flora of the bowel, perineum, vagina, and cervix. The strongest risk factor for endometritis is a cesarean section. A woman presents with fever and foul-smelling vaginal discharge 3 days after delivery of a full-term fetus. She is febrile, with uterine tenderness on pelvic exam. Which of the following is the strongest risk factor for postpartum endometritis?A) Cesarean sectionB) Internal fetal monitoringC) Multiple gestationD) Premature rupture of membranes B) Continue breastfeeding to decrease the chance of the mastitis progressing to a breast abscessDiscontinuing breastfeeding is not recommended (C) and (D) because breast milk helps improve the infant's immunity and provided the right amount of nutritional support. Breastfeeding also enhances the mother-infant bonding experience. The small bacteria load in the nipple will not help to develop the infant's immune system (A). The infant received passive immunity from direct immunoglobulins in the breast milk. A 28-year-old woman who has been breastfeeding her baby for approximately 3 months visits her physician complaining of breast tenderness and fevers. After assessing the patient, the physician believes that she is experiencing mastitis. The patient is started on analgesics and antibiotics. What should the physician recommend in terms of breastfeeding from the affected breast?A) Continue breastfeeding since the small bacterial load can help develop the infant's immune systemB) Continue breastfeeding to decrease the chance of the mastitis progressing to a breast abscessC) Discontinue breastfeeding to allow time for proper healingD) Discontinue breastfeeding to decrease bacterial spread to the infant Cephalosporins or dicloxacillin are the preferred antibiotics. What is the preferred antibiotic treatment for mastitis infections? Estrogen plus progestinAndrostenedione (A & B) is a precursor hormone in the biosynthesis of estrogen. Its transformation requires an ovary to be receptive to luteinizing hormone, a process which does not occur in menopause. Estrogen alone (C) is the treatment in women who have had a hysterectomy.In women who have not had a hysterectomy, estrogen plus progestin is recommended to prevent endometrial hyperplasia. You have been monitoring a 52-year-old perimenopausal woman's hot flashes. She has not had a hysterectomy. Her symptoms have been so mild that she does not require medication. However, for the past two months, her hot flashes have increased in frequency, duration and intensity. She is now asking for a medication. Which of the following is the most appropriate for medical management of her moderate to severe symptoms?Androstenedione aloneAndrostenedione plus estrogenEstrogen aloneEstrogen plus progestin If estrogen is contraindicated in a postmenopausal woman, which alternative medication can be used to treat significant hot flashes, especially if there is concurrent sleep disturbance? Pelvic inflammatory diseaseAppendicitis (A) and ectopic pregnancy (B) are surgical emergencies that must be ruled out in a young female patient with lower abdominal pain, but the patient history of unprotected sexual encounters with multiple partners points to a diagnosis of PID. A thorough sexual and menstrual history should be completed, and a pregnancy test (D) is indicated, however lower abdominal pain and vaginal discharge are not indicative of pregnancy. A previously healthy 21-year-old woman presents to your office with a complaint of lower abdominal discomfort and vaginal discharge for the past 2 weeks. She is currently single, but admits to occasionally ""fooling around"" with men she meets at parties. She expresses concern that she might be pregnant because of increasing tenderness in her lower abdomen for the past 3 days. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?AppendicitisEctopic pregnancyPelvic inflammatory diseasePregnancy B) Admit to obstetrics for deliveryCorticosteroids (A) have not been shown to be effective in patients with PROM (as opposed to those with preterm PROM). Amoxicillin (C) should be considered in PROM if there are signs of infection. Tocolysis (D) is controversial and delivery is preferred. No pharmacologic agents are completely effective and there is no evidence that tocolytic therapy directly improves neonatal outcome. An 18-year-old woman at 37 weeks gestation presents with a spontaneous leakage of fluid from the vagina. She has no other signs of active labor. Vital signs are unremarkable and the patient has no complaints except for the leakage of fluid. What management is indicated?A) Administer corticosteroidsB) Admit to obstetrics for deliveryC) Amoxicillin IVD) Tocolysis (Mag sulfate, terbutaline, nifedipine, endomethacin) TdapLive vaccinations pose a theoretical risk to the fetus and are contraindicated in pregnant women. While live attenuated influenza vaccine (A) administered intranasally is contraindicated, inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended to any woman who is or will be pregnant (any trimester) during influenza season. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine (B) and varicella vaccine (D) are also live vaccines and should not be administered to pregnant patients. Which of the following vaccinations is considered safe in pregnancy? Live attenuated influenzaMeasles, mumps, rubellaTdapVaricella Uterine atonyAmniotic fluid embolism (A) is a rare but often fatal obstetric complication in which amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation, leading to cardiopulmonary collapse and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. Dehiscence of a cesarean section incision (B) may also lead to hemorrhage in the postpartum state, but this patient delivered vaginally. In Rh sensitization (C), maternal antibodies are made against fetal red blood cells. With subsequent pregnancies, the placental transmission of these antibodies can lead to a devastating fetal, not maternal, anemia. A 26-year-old woman just vaginally delivered twin, macrosomic newborn boys. This represents her fourth pregnancy, which has been the longest of them all at 43 weeks gestation. Her delivery was difficult and required forceps to complete. Estimated blood loss was 1100 ml. Currently, she is hypotensive, tachycardic and anemic. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?Amniotic fluid embolismIncision dehiscenceRh sensitizationUterine atony Placenta accreta, increta and percreta; three different forms of abnormal placenta-uterus separation. D) Squamous cell carcinoma Human papillomavirus is found in more than 99% of all cervical cancers and causes the development of cervical neoplasia. Risk factors for cervical cancer include activities that lead to infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), oral contraceptive use and cigarette smoking. The most common type of cervical cancer is squamous cell carcinoma, which is found in 69% of cases of cervical cancer in the United States.Adenocarcinoma (A) is the second most common type of cervical cancer. It is found in 25% of cases of cervical cancer in the United States. Other histologies make up 6% of cases of cervical cancer including cervical sarcoma (B) and small cell carcinoma (C). Which of the following is the most common type of cervical cancer?A) Adenocarcinoma B) Cervical sarcomaC) Small cell carcinomaD) Squamous cell carcinoma C) Magnesium sulfateA pregnant or recently postpartum patient with new-onset seizure should be considered to have eclampsia. Most cases of eclampsia occur in the 3rd trimester, with approximately 80% occurring during delivery or within the first 48 hours after delivery, though seizures may occur as late as several weeks postpartum. Seizures are most commonly tonic-clonic and last 60 to 90 seconds. Magnesium sulfate is the drug of choice for eclamptic seizures. A loading dose of 4-6 g of magnesium sulfate should be administered over 15-20 minutes followed by a maintenance infusion of 1-2 g per hour. Most eclamptic seizures terminate with magnesium. Labetalol (A) may be used to control severe hypertension in a patient with preeclampsia or eclampsia, but does not treat seizures. Lorazepam (B) and phenobarbital (D) are second- and third-line choices, respectively, if eclamptic seizures are refractory to magnesium. A 29-year-old woman who is two weeks postpartum following an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery of a full-term infant is brought in by emergency medical services with an ongoing generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Which of the following medications should be administered first? A) LabetalolB) LorazepamC) Magnesium sulfateD) Phenobarbital C) Predominance of gram negative rods on gram stainvaginal pH of 5.5 (D) is characteristic of both bacterial vaginosis and trichmoniasis.Improvement on oral metronidazole (A) is characteristic of both bacterial vaginosis and trichmoniasis. Patients taking metronidazole should be cautioned about a disulfiram-like reaction if alcohol is consumed during a course of metronidazole. Multiple punctate hemorrhagic cervical lesions (B) describe the classic ""strawberry cervix"" that is associated with trichmoniasis. A 15-year-old girl complains of vaginal discharge over the past two weeks. She reports recently becoming sexually active but uses condoms consistently during intercourse. Which of the following favors a diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis over trichmoniasis?A) Improvement on oral metronidazoleB) Multiple punctate hemorrhagic cervical lesionsC) Predominance of gram negative rods on gram stainD) Vaginal pH of 5.5 B) Suction curettageAdjuvant interventions include establishing large-bore intravenous access, uterine massage, oxytocin, methylergonovine maleate and alerting the operating room.If curettage fails, then one should consider a more advanced hemostatic treatment like uterine artery or hypogastric artery ligation (C) or arterial embolization. Obtaining a blood type (A) and alerting the blood bank is wise in managing any patient with hemorrhage. However, in this case, it should not supersede a definitive treatment like curettage. Packing the uterine cavity with gauze (D), once commonplace, is seldom used today as it is only a temporizing maneuver. A 30-year-old woman, who had an uncomplicated pregnancy, delivered a healthy newborn a few minutes ago. She just now delivered a placenta with absent cotyledons. Copious amounts of blood begin to flow from the vaginal orifice. Within minutes, the patient becomes lightheaded but maintains consciousness. You attempt manual extraction but the bleeding continues and the blood pressure decreases to 98/68 mmHg. Which of the following is the next best step in management of postpartum hemorrhage?A) Blood type and cross-matchB) Suction curettage C) Uterine artery ligation D) Uterine packing with gauze B) Admit for further obstetrics evaluationUltimately, delivery is the potentially curative therapy for preeclampsia but at this stage in pregnancy, an emergent cesarean section (D) would not be indicated.Phenytoin (B) is not indicated for seizure prophylaxis in preeclampsia. Instead, magnesium is the drug of choice for seizure prophylaxis when necessary. Patients with mild preeclampsia without symptoms or isolated maternal hypertension can be managed as outpatients (C) but not those with severe preeclampsia. A 17-year-old G1P0 woman at 25-weeks gestation presents with intermittent blurred vision. On presentation, she is asymptomatic. Vital signs are HR 84, BP 175/113, oxygen saturation 97%. Physical examination reveals 2+ pitting edema on both lower extremities and urinalysis has 3+ protein on dip. Which of the following is most likely indicated?A) Administration of PhenytoinB) Admit for further obstetrics evaluationC) Arrange follow up with the patient's obstetricianD) Emergency cesarean section D) Uterine ablationColposcopy (A) is a gynecologic procedure in which the cervix, vagina and vulva are directly visualized under illumination and magnification. Hysteroscopy (C) is the current gold standard for evaluating uterine pathology. Both of these diagnostic tests would not treat nor prevent further menstrual bleeding. Hysterectomy (B) may be a last resort, but endometrial ablation is usually attempted first as hysterectomy has a high risk of perioperative complications and prolonged recovery. A 41-year-old woman suffers from heavy and irregular menses, which at times leads to fatigue, lightheadedness and dyspnea. She has had three hospitalizations in the past year for such episodes. Her gynecologic evaluation has not revealed any pathological cause. The heavy menses continue despite hormonal therapy. She states she is done with child bearing. Which of the following treatment options should be considered next?A) ColposcopyB) HysterectomyC) HysteroscopyD) Uterine ablation C) Levonorgestrel intrauterine deviceProgestin-only pills (D) are most effective in women who are exclusively breastfeeding. They are not as effective in pregnancy prevention in other circumstances. Combined oral contraceptives (A) and the etonogestral/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ring (B) contain estrogen and therefore would be contraindicated in this patient whom is taking antiepileptic drugs.Certain antiepileptic drugs induce hepatic metabolism of estrogen (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, and topiramate). This can potentially lead to failure of any contraceptive that contains estrogen. Therefore progestin only birth control methods would be beneficial to this patient. The levonorgestrel intrauterine device and copper intrauterine device are acceptable choices even for a nulligravida. The levonorgestrel intrauterine device is a progestin only device that can be used for either 3 years or 5 years depending on if it is the Skyla® or the Mirena® device. A 23-year-old nulligravida comes to your office for contraception counseling. She has a seizure disorder that is well controlled on carbamazepine. She is a nonsmoker and has no other medical problems or complaints. She is currently in a relationship and does not want to get pregnant in the next several years. Which one of the following contraceptives is the most appropriate?A) Combined oral contraceptivesB) Etonogestrel/ethinyl estradiol vaginal ringC) Levonorgestrel intrauterine deviceD) Progestin-only pills D) Thyroid-stimulating hormoneSerum sex steroids (A) and gonadotropins (B) are similar in women with or without premenstrual syndrome. A woman with current regular menstrual cycles is unlikely to be pregnant, as such, a human chorionic gonadotropin (C) level is unrevealing.It is important to remember that other common conditions, such as thyroid disorders and hypercortisolism, can mimic the behavioral and affective changes of premenstrual syndrome. A 22-year-old woman with regular menstrual cycles presents with symptoms concordant with premenstrual syndrome. In evaluating the large differential of these symptoms, which of the following serum laboratory tests is recommended?A) EstrogenB) Follicle stimulating hormoneC) Human chorionic gonadotropinD) Thyroid-stimulating hormone A) ChorioamnionitisEndometritis (B) in an infection of the uterine endometrium that affects between 2 and 8% of pregnancies. The infection develops on the second or third post-partum day and is characterized by fever, abdominal pain and foul-smelling lochia. Pelvic inflammatory disease (C) does not occur during this stage of pregnancy due to the mucous plug that seals the cervix. It may occur during the first trimester although it is quite rare. A urinary tract infection (D) does not cause systemic signs of infection as described in the patient unless it has moved to the upper urinary tract causing pyelonephritis.Beginning at 16 weeks, the membranes of the chorioamniotic sac adhere to the cervical os and are at risk for infection. Chorioamnionitis is an intra-amniotic infection of the chorion and amniotic layers of the amniotic sac. The placenta and fetal membranes may also be involved. It is caused by an ascending infection of normal vaginal flora. A 21-year-old woman with no prenatal care presents for evaluation of lower abdominal pain and fever. She estimates that she is approximately 7.5 months pregnant. On questioning, she acknowledges intermittent pain for two days and a gush of fluid shortly after the pain began. Her temperature is 101.8°F. Physical examination is notable for purulent material in the vaginal vault. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?A) ChorioamnionitisB) EndometritisC) Pelvic inflammatory diseaseD) Urinary tract infection D) Vaginal hysterctomyVaginal hysterectomy is associated with better outcomes and fewer complications than laparoscopic or abdominal hysterectomy (A). Operative management of an enterocele with an anterior colporrhaphy (B), or a rectocele with a posterior colporrhaphy (C) is often performed at the time of operation for uterine prolapse after the patient has undergone a hysterectomy, but is not the surgical treatment for uterine prolapse. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for stage IV uterine prolapse in a 50-year-old woman with no medical problems and no previous surgical history?A) Abdominal hysterectomyB) Anterior colporrhaphyC) Posterior colporrhaphyD) Vaginal hysterctomy D) Urine cultureHepatitis C antibodies (A) screening is not recommended in all pregnant patients. Hepatitis C infection should be screened for in high risk patients, such as patients with a history of illicit drug use, patients with HIV, incarcerated patients, and patients whose current sexual partner is infected with hepatitis C. Thyroid stimulating hormone (B) is not recommended in all pregnant patients. The American College of Gynecology and Obstetrics recommend testing patients for thyroid dysfunction if they have any of the following: symptoms of thyroid disease, personal or family history of thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes, goiter, history of neck or head radiation, and amiodarone or lithium use. Tuberculin skin testing (C) for latent tuberculosis is not indicated in all pregnant women. Tuberculosis screening is recommended in patients who are immunosuppressed and in patients who are in close contact with individuals with active tuberculosis. Which of the following laboratory studies should be performed on all pregnant women during the initial prenatal visit? A) Hepatitis C antibodiesB) Thyroid stimulating hormoneC) Tuberculin skin testingD) Urine culture C) Treat her asthma as indicated, if improved, discharge with outpatient obstetrical follow-up Treatment should not be delayed (A). In fact, the most important aspect to assuring the health of the fetus is to ensure the health of the mother. No further workup of the patient's pregnancy is required (B and D). Her respiratory complaints are unrelated to her pregnancy.As a good public health practice, many EDs offer routine screening for pregnancy using point-of-care testing. In this patient—with isolated respiratory complaints and lack of findings on physical or pelvic exam that indicate anything other than a normal pregnancy—an incidental positive beta-hCG does not warrant any further attention other than a referral for follow-up with an obstetrician. The patient's asthma is the treatment priority. Standard therapy should be administered even in the setting of pregnancy. A 40-year-old woman with a history of asthma presents to the ED with symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath similar to previous exacerbations. Her vital signs are BP 115/70, HR 80, RR, 14, and pulse oximetry is 99% on room air. The patient is offered and agrees to a point-of-care beta-hCG test that returns positive. Upon further questioning, patient denies any vaginal or urinary complaints. On exam, you note mild bilateral wheezing with good air movement. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?A) Delay treating her asthma until her pregnancy status is further clarifiedB) Treat her asthma as indicated, and perform a beta-hCG quantitative levelC) Treat her asthma as indicated, if improved, discharge with outpatient obstetrical follow-up D) Treat her asthma as indicated, perform a beta-hCG quantitative level, and obtain a pelvic ultrasound Measles (Rubeola)Initial signs and symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 °C (104.0 °F), cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. Two or three days after the start of symptoms, small white spots may form inside the mouth, known as Koplik's spots. A red, flat rash which usually starts on the face and then spreads to the rest of the body typically begins three to five days after the start of symptoms. Symptoms usually develop 10-12 days after exposure to an infected person and last 7-10 days. Complications occur in about 30% and may include diarrhea, blindness, inflammation of the brain, and pneumonia among others. Rubella (German Measles)Symptoms often appear two to three weeks after exposure, and also include mild fever and headache. The rash is sometimes itchy and is not as bright as that of measles. Swollen lymph nodes are common and may last a few weeks. A fever, sore throat, and fatigue may also occur. In adults joint pain is common. Chicken Pox also known as varicella, is a highly contagious disease caused by the initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV). The disease results in a characteristic skin rash that forms small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over. It usually starts on the chest, back, and face then spreads to the rest of the body. Other symptoms may include fever, tiredness, and headaches. Symptoms usually last five to seven days. small, itchy blisters, which eventually scab over, usually starts on the chest, back, and face then spreads to the rest of the body. RoseolaMost infections occur before the age of three. Symptoms vary from absent to the classic presentation of a fever of rapid onset followed by a rash. The fever generally lasts for three to five days. The rash is generally pink and lasts for less than three days. Complications may include febrile seizures, with serious complications being rare. fever of rapid onset followed by a rash in children usually under 3 yrs of age. Koplik's spotsclustered, white lesions on the buccal mucosa (opposite the lower 1st & 2nd molars) and are pathognomonic for measles Colles' fractureconsist of a fracture of the distal radial metaphyseal region with dorsal angulation and impaction, but without the involvement of the articular surface. The most common type of distal radial fracture. Most Colles fractures are secondary to a fall on an outstretched hand (FOOSH) with a pronated forearm in dorsiflexion (the position one adopts when trying to break a forward fall). The vast majority of Colles fractures can be treated with closed reduction and cast immobilization. Smith FractureSmith fractures, also known as Goyrand fractures in the French literature 3, are fractures of the distal radius with associated palmar angulation of the distal fracture fragment. Classically, these fractures are extra-articular transverse fractures and can be thought of as a reverse Colles fracture. C) Diabetes mellitusDiabetes mellitus (DM) is an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis. The risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in a patient with diabetes is the same risk as someone without diabetes who has had a previous MI. The risk of death from cardiac events is also the same between the 2 groups. Patients with diabetes mellitus should be advised to stop smoking and aggressively control other risk factors, such as glucose, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, in order to reduce the risk of ischemic heart disease. A 54-year-old man presents with chest pain. He has a past medical history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus. The pain is located in the middle of his chest and radiates to his jaw. The pain began about 20 minutes ago, and he rates the pain as a 10 on a 0 - 10 point scale, with 10 being the worst pain he has ever felt. He has had 3 similar episodes, but they have always resolved after 5 minutes or so of rest. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes a day for the past 36 years. He drinks 2 or 3 beers on Friday nights. Review of systems (ROS) is positive for diaphoresis, acute dyspnea, and impending doom. ROS negative for fever, chills, and malaise. Physical exam shows an obese, middle-aged man in moderate distress. BP 126/80, pulse 100, respirations 26. Heart and lung exams are normal, except for tachycardia and tachypnea. He has no pedal edema. What aspect of the patient's history is the largest risk factor for an acute myocardial infarction? A) Alcohol useB) Cigarette smokingC) Diabetes mellitusD) HypertensionE) Obesity C) SclerotherapyThis patient's diagnosis is varicose veins. Sclerotherapy can be used to treat varicose veins. It involves the injection of an irritating solution into the varicose vein to promote an inflammatory response, scarring, and obliteration of the lumenHint: Warfarin is indicated for myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident prevention and in patients with atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, or deep venous thrombosisHint: Cilostazol and clopidogrel both inhibit platelets. Clopidogrel is used in CAD and CVA prevention, as well as post-ST-segment MI. Cilostazol lowers lipid levels and is indicated in peripheral arterial disease. A 45-year-old woman with a no significant past medical history presents with a 4-month history of dull, aching heaviness sensation in her proximal right leg. She notes that this sensation is provoked by extended periods of standing and walking, and is relieved when she lies in a recumbent position. Her past medical history is remarkable for pregnancy 4 times, the most recent being approximately 2 years ago. She denies a history of smoking, trauma, injuries, fever, chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, hemoptysis, cough, skin changes and coolness, and peripheral edema. Her physical exam reveals several dilated, tortuous, elongated veins along the medial right thigh, which are especially pronounced upon standing. The remainder of the physical exam is normal. What will be the most appropriate therapeutic approach for this patient at this time?A) Warfarin (Coumadin)B) Clopidogrel (Plavix)C) SclerotherapyD) Furosemide (Lasix)E) Cilostazol (Pletal) In the hypertensive patient with sudden loss of consciousness and decerebrate response (extensor posturing), you should consider brain stem hemorrhage. Abnormal breathing patterns can be observed in both pontine and medullary lesions; they sometimes can be prognostic. Her breathing pattern is apneustic. Apneustic breathing pattern characterizes deep, gasping inspiration with a pause at full inspiration followed by a brief, insufficient release and the end-inspiration pause before expiration. Lesion in the pons or upper medulla causes the removal of input from the vagus nerve and the pneumotaxic center. Normally, apneustic center of the lower pons promotes inspiration by stimulation of the dorsal respiratory center in the medulla to delay the 'switch off' signal of the inspiratory ramp provided by the pneumotaxic center of pons. Therefore, athe pneustic center controls the intensity of breathing. Apneusis is an ominous sign, with a generally poor prognosis. A 62-year-old woman with a long-standing history of hypertension presents with a severe headache; it started this morning and is rapidly worsening. During the interview, she suddenly collapses. Your brief examination shows that she responds with extensor posturing on external stimuli. Her deep tendon reflexes are 3, and you elicit Babinski bilaterally. You also notice that her breathing has a peculiar pattern: deep inspiration with a pause at full inspiration, followed by a brief insufficient release and the end-inspiration pause. A) Cheyne-StokesB) ApneusisC) AtaxicD) ClusterE) Kussmaul A) Cheyne-StokesIncreased CO2 during the period of apnea causes compensatory hyperventilation. Hyperventilation in turn causes the decrease in CO2, which causes apnea and the cycle to restart. Causes include CNS dysfunction, cardiac failure with low cardiac output, sleep, hypoxia, or profound hypocapnia. An abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by repetitive progressively deeper and sometimes faster breathing, followed by a gradual decrease in breathing that results in temporary apnea. Cycles usually take 30 seconds to 2 minutes. What is the breathing pattern?A) Cheyne-StokesB) ApneusisC) AtaxicD) ClusterE) Kussmaul C) Ataxic (Biot's)It is generally a poor prognostic sign. Biot's respiration is caused by the medullary lesion due to strokes or trauma or by pressure on the medulla due to uncal or tentorial herniation. An abnormal pattern of breathing characterized by groups of quick, shallow inspirations followed by regular or irregular periods of apnea. What is the breathing pattern?A) Cheyne-StokesB) ApneusisC) AtaxicD) ClusterE) Kussmaul D) ClusterIt is generally seen in lesions in the low pons or upper medulla. It differs from Cheyne-Stokes pattern because there is no increasing and decreasing depth of respirations. Irregular breathing with periods of apnea that occurs at irregular intervals. What is the breathing pattern?A) Cheyne-StokesB) ApneusisC) AtaxicD) ClusterE) Kussmaul E) Kussmaulseen often in severe metabolic acidosis (diabetic ketoacidosis, renal failure). In metabolic acidosis, breathing is first rapid and shallow, but later on, as acidosis worsens, breathing gradually becomes Kussmaul breathing. A deep, labored, and gasping breathing pattern. What is the breathing pattern?A) Cheyne-StokesB) ApneusisC) AtaxicD) ClusterE) Kussmaul C) Protein C deficiencyDeficiency of pro-coagulants causes bleeding diathesis while deficiency of anti-coagulants causes recurrent episodes of thrombosis. Protein C is a potent anti-coagulant. Both protein C and co-factor protein S are vitamin K dependent peptides. Protein C, which is produced by the liver, is a powerful naturally occurring anti-coagulant and is activated by thrombin. Thrombin (a powerful pro-coagulant) activates protein C after binding with a factor known as thrombomodulin. Activated protein C digests factor VIIIA and Va. Protein S is produced by endothelial cells and acts as a co-factor for protein C. Deficiency of what factor may predispose a person to recurrent thrombosis?A) Platelet deficiencyB) Factor VIIIC deficiencyC) Protein C deficiencyD) von Willebrand factor deficiencyE) Factor VII deficiency C) EmphysemaThe classical symptomatology includes prolonged progressive dyspnea with late-onset non-productive cough, occasional mucopurulent relapses, and eventual cachexia and respiratory failure. The patients are usually thin and have a barrel-shaped chest. There is tachypnea with pursed lip breathing and use of accessory muscles; they may also adopt a tripod sitting position. Hint: Chronic bronchitis produces obstructive changes and bronchial inflammation. Chronic bronchitis is characterized by chronic productive cough for at least 3 or more months in each of 2 successive years for which other causes, such as infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, carcinoma of the lung, or chronic heart failure, have been excluded. Chest X-ray shows increased bronchovascular markings and cardiomegaly.Hint: Bronchiectasis is a condition characterized by abnormal permanent distortion of the conducting bronchi or airways, most often secondary to an infectious process. Patient with bronchiectasis often present with chronic cough with mucopurulent sputum production, which lasts months to years. CT, especially HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography), helps in confirming the diagnosis. A 45-year-old man presents with a 2-year history of worsening dyspnea and a 1-month history of a dry cough. The patient gives no history of fever, chills, chest pain, or wheeze. History is significant for smoking (25 cigarettes/day for more than 22 years). A chest X-ray shows hyperinflated lungs with bullae, tubular heart, flattened diaphragm, and no areas of consolidation. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) reveal a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) along with reduction of FEV1/FVC (forced vital capacity) ratio. These findings are characteristic of what condition? A) Congestive cardiac failureB) Chronic bronchitisC) EmphysemaD) BronchiectasisE) Diffuse alveolar damage B) Synchronized cardioversionTachycardia can be classified based on the appearance of the QRS complex on the ECG as narrow and wide complex tachycardia. Narrow complex tachycardia consists of sinus tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, AV nodal reentry, and atrial tachycardia (ectopic and reentrant). Wide complex tachycardia consists of ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachycardia with aberrancy. The patient presents with a tachycardia and associated serious symptoms of faintness, shortness of breath, chest pain and apprehension, mild hypotension, and peripheral vasoconstriction. Thus, while young patients can tolerate a rapid heartbeat for some time, this patient would be classified as hemodynamically unstable. The treatment of choice for unstable patients with a narrow complex tachycardia would be immediate synchronized cardioversion. However, whenever possible, it is advisable to provide analgesia and sedation for conscious patients before cardioversion. A 15-year-old girl presents with a 1-hour history of rapid heartbeat, faintness, sweating, and nervousness. She is also experiencing shortness of breath and chest pain. The patient has no significant past medical history. There is no history of similar episodes. The patient is on no medications, and she denies illicit drug use. On exam, her vital signs are BP70/60 mmHg; pulse 200 bpm; RR 22/min, temperature afebrile. She looks pale, and her palms are slightly sweaty. She is not comfortable sitting up, so she prefers lying down. She looks slightly apprehensive. Her heart and lung exam are negative except for the tachycardia; except for cool sweaty hands, a brief abdominal and extremity exam are non-revealing. The physician quickly places the paddles on the patient's chest to record the rhythm; this shows a narrow-complex regular tachycardia at 210 bpm. He requests oxygen, IV line, and continuous monitoring. An EKG is in the process of being completed. A) Carotid sinus massageB) Synchronized cardioversionC) Adenosine 6 mg IV pushD) Diltiazem 10 mg IV pushE) Verapamil 5 mg IV push C) 100 JoulesOf all of the arrhythmias, both supraventricular and ventricular, atrial flutter is the easiest to cardiovert back to a regular sinus rhythm. The temptation, especially when using front-to-back paddles, is to use the lowest voltage setting (e.g., 50 Joules, or 25 Joules, or even 10 Joules). That temptation needs to be resisted; if the initial electric shock is ineffective, then the circulating catecholamine levels of the patient become markedly increased, which thereby places the patient at risk of developing potentially fatal ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest with subsequent electric shocks. In contrast, there is no need to apply higher energies such as 200 Joules, 300 Joules, or 360 Joules as the initial energy for cardioversion in case of atrial flutter. The most reasonable approach is to provide a 100 Joules direct current countershock which will have a high probability of returning the patient with atrial flutter to a regular sinus rhythm while maintaining a low probability of causing burns or broken bones with 1 and only 1 direct current moderate-energy 100 Joules electric shock. A 40-year-old man presents with atrial flutter with 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) conduction, giving him a pulse of 150 per minute, which is perfectly regular. He takes no medications regularly. You plan to provide him with urgent direct current cardioversion with conscious sedation. What should be used as the initial energy for cardioversion in order to restore sinus rhythm in patients with atrial flutter?A) 10 JoulesB) 25 JoulesC) 100 JoulesD) 200 JoulesE) 300 Joules B) No diagnostic tests are necessaryThis patient's diagnosis is a posterior anal fissure. Along with a history, the diagnosis can usually be made based on findings from a gentle perianal examination with inspection of the anal mucosa. In this case, no diagnostic procedures are required. A digital rectal examination is painful and often can be deferred. Anoscopy may be required for lesions that are not well-visualized; however, this is not well tolerated by a patient with an acute anal fissure. In this case, anoscopy can often be deferred; the patient can be treated based only on the symptoms. If an ordinary anal fissure is suspected, and if it is located in the posterior or anterior midline, then no laboratory or imaging tests are necessary. If the fissure is off the midline or irregular, or if an underlying illness (e.g., Crohn disease, squamous cell cancer, AIDS) may be present, then the appropriate tests should be ordered. These tests include erythrocyte sedimentation rate, stool and viral cultures, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)testing,and biopsy of the lesion/fissure. A 51-year-old man presents with a 3-day history of severe pain associated with bowel movements. The pain lasts up to 1 hour following each bowel movement. His stools are described as ""hard"", but they retain their normal brown color, with the occasional presence of a few drops of bright red blood. His dietary history is remarkable for a low-fiber diet lacking in raw fruits and vegetables. He denies any sexual contact, drug use, or other gastrointestinal symptoms. He takes ferrous sulfate for anemia and oxycodone for chronic joint pain. His rectal exam reveals a small tear in the lining of the anus. What is the most appropriate diagnostic test to order at this time?A) CT scan of the abdomen and pelvisB) No diagnostic tests are necessaryC) HIV ELISA testD) AnoscopyE) Rectal biopsy C) ConjunctivitisConjunctivitis can be caused by bacterial, viral, allergic, and irritant etiologies. Clients usually complain of red eyes and a sticky or watery discharge. The type of discharge helps to determine the etiology-watery in viral, and sticky green or yellow, in bacterial conjunctivitis. Irritation is common, but severe pain and photophobia are not. Bacterial or viral conjunctivitis is usually self-limited, but it may be treated with a topical antibiotic, without steroids, such as sulfacetamide (10% 3-4 times/day). Topical aminoglycoside should be reserved for more refractory disease. Allergic conjunctivitis may be effectively treated with a new class of non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory agents. Irritant conjunctivitis, including dry eyes, may be treated with topical, non-preserved lubricants. A white female comes into the evening clinic with a complaint of red eyes with a sticky discharge. Her eye feels irritated, the pain is mild. She tells you she shared towels with her boyfriend who had a red eye. She asks you if you think her boyfriend gave her an infection. What is your working diagnosis?A) BlepharitisB) ChalazionC) ConjunctivitisD) EctropionE) Foreign Body E) Foreign BodyForeign Body sensation is most commonly due to corneal or conjunctival foreign bodies. Other causes are disturbances of the corneal epithelium and rubbing of eyelashes against the cornea (trichiasis). A white male comes into the ER with the complaint of pain in his right eye. He was whittling and felt like something went into his eye. This happened four hours ago. He has washed his eye with water, but it still feels funny. What is your working diagnosis?A) BlepharitisB) ChalazionC) ConjunctivitisD) EctropionE) Foreign Body A) LithiumLithium, used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, is a common cause of diabetes insipidus. It is freely filtered through the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubule along with sodium and water. Even small doses of lithium may cause diabetes insipidus. Lithium can also make the distal renal tubules resistant to the action of vasopressin. This patient had recently started this medication, which resulted in his new symptomsVasopressin = anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) which would do the opposite; it causes the kidneys to reabsorb solute-free water and return it to the circulation. This person is dumping water. A 25-year-old man presents with increased urination and thirst. Over the past 3 days, he has been unable to satisfy his thirst and has to urinate up to 20 times per day. He noticed that his urine is very clear and colorless. In general, he feels very weak. He has never had any problems with urination before. His medical history is remarkable for a recently diagnosed psychiatric condition for which he began medical treatment. On physical exam, he appears to be lethargic, dehydrated, and pale. His vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 96/52 mm of Hg, temperature 101.2 degrees Fahrenheit, pulse 108 beats per minute, and a respiratory rate of 26 per minute. Which of the following is a common cause of diabetes insipidus?A) LithiumB) Carbamazepine (Tegretol)C) Amitriptyline (Elavil)D) Valproic acid (Valproate)E) Vasopressin C) NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)The patient has pleuritis without effusion. Pleuritis is inflammation of the pleura. It may occur with or without effusion and is characterized by a sharp pain worsened by cough and inspiration. The pain may radiate to the shoulder if the diaphragmatic pleura is affected and pressure around the area of inflammation may produce pain. Friction rub is heard on auscultation. The pleuritic chest pain causes shallow rapid breaths. The presentation with flu-like illness, malaise, absence of history of collagen vascular disease, and CXR findings makes the most likely etiology viral in this case. Pleuritis is treated with NSAIDs. Ibuprofen can be given in the dose of 400 - 800 mg orally 3 times daily for pain management in case of pleurisy due to viral etiology. Other examples of etiologic agents are rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, radiation, pneumonia, acute pulmonary embolism, and pneumothorax. A 52-year-old woman living a non-sedentary lifestyle presents with a 5-day history of low-grade fever, flu-like syndrome, sore throat, and malaise. She is mostly bothered by the fact that she has to ""catch"" her breath because of pain on inspiration and when coughing. She has no known past medical or surgical history; she is not on any medication, and she has no pertinent family history. She denies any medication use, including over-the-counter medicines. On physical examination, her vitals are: Temperature 100.6 F, pulse 86/min, BP133/75 mm Hg, and RR 20cycles/min. She has shallow breathing, resonant percussion notes, fair air entry with vesicular breath sounds, and friction rub. Her blood gas on room air is: pH 7.36, PCO2 44 mmHg, PO2 100 mmHg, HCO3 26 mEq\L, O2 saturation 99.8%. Her chest X-ray (CXR) is normal and the D-dimer assay is also normal. What is the most appropriate management modality for this patient?A) ReassuranceB) IV heparinC) NSAIDs (Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)D) V/Q scan (ventilation/perfusion scan)E) CT scan (Computed Tomography) B) Computerized tomographic angiography (CTA)The clinical picture is most compatible with a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). Pulmonary embolism is a condition in which there is sudden lodgment of a blood clot in a pulmonary artery with cause subsequent obstruction of blood supply to the lung parenchyma. The clinical manifestations of PE are usually nonspecific and vary in frequency and intensity depending on the extent of pulmonary vascular occlusion, pre-embolic cardiopulmonary function, and the development of pulmonary infarction. Small thromboemboli may be asymptomatic. The most common symptoms of PE include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, and hemoptysis. Based on the acuity and severity of pulmonary arterial occlusion, PE can be categorized into 4 types as massive PE, acute pulmonary infarction, acute embolism without infarction, and multiple pulmonary emboli. CTA is the initial imaging technique of choice in stable patients. The ventilation perfusion scanning (V/Q)/lung scan is also an important diagnostic modality for the diagnosis of PE with a reasonable possibility of either confirming the diagnosis (with a ""high-probability"" scan) or ruling it out (with a normal scan). However, CTA has largely replaced it as the initial modality of imaging in stable patients and V/Q scanning is usually done if CT is not available or the person has a contraindication to CT or the intravenous dye. A 56-year-old man presents with moderately severe chest pain. His pain is substernal and left anterolateral; there is some exacerbation on inspiration, and it has been increasing in severity over the last 36 hours. He works as a truck driver and has a history of heavy cigarette smoking, hypertension, and obesity. Over the past week, he has experienced swelling and discomfort in his right calf. Examination shows: BP - 90/55 mm Hg, P - 122/min, RR - 40/min, and temp - 37.6° C. He is mildly agitated and confused. Systemic examination reveals: heart: tachycardia, soft systolic murmur, questionable ventricular gallop. Chest: dullness to percussion left base with scattered crackles and wheezes throughout. Abdomen: negative. Extremities: right calf is 0.5 cm larger than left with some deep tenderness and a trace of ankle edema. Neurologic: no deficits. Laboratory: Hgb- 16.4g/dL, Hct 51%, WBC 12,300 cells/ µL, PaO2 52 mmHg, PaCO2 38 mmHg, and pH 7.35. Chest radiograph: borderline cardiomegaly and a prominent aorta; scattered patchy infiltrates bilaterally, small left pleural effusion. What is the most accurate diagnostic modality for diagnosing this patient's condition??* A) Impedance plethysmographyB) Computerized tomographic angiography (CTA)C) SpirometryD) Myocardial scanE) Cardiac ultrasound A) ColonoscopyThe best test to recommend is a colonoscopy since it detects both polyps and cancer. Colorectal cancer is the 4th most common form of cancer in the United States; it arises from adenomatous polyps in the colon. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) has different inheritance patterns and different genetic causes. In this patient, the pattern is probably autosomal dominant which puts him at a risk of nearly 100% for developing colorectal cancer by the age of 40. That means that screening tests for colorectal cancer must be performed earlier than suggested for the rest of the population (i.e., before the age of 50). A fecal occult blood test, fecal immunochemical test, and stool DNA test (sDNA) find cancer, not polyps. The AFP (alpha-fetoprotein) tumor marker is a useful marker for hepatocellular carcinoma and germ cell tumors, but not for colorectal cancer. A 35-year-old man has a routine physical examination with no abnormal findings. His family history, however, is positive for familial adenomatous polyposis. What screening test would be best for him to obtain? A) ColonoscopyB) No screening necessary before the age of 50C) Fecal occult blood testD) Stool DNA test (sDNA)E) AFP tumor marker C) ScabiesUsually spares the neck & face. - commonly found in the intertriginous zones including web spaces between fingers/toes, scalp. Intensely pruritic lesions: Intense pruritus with minimal skin findings increased intensity at night*A) LiceB) Molluscum contagiosumC) ScabiesD) Tinea infections B) Permethrin topicalThe patient has Scabies. Topical Permethrin is treatment of choice. Lindane is 2nd line. Can also try 6-10% sulfur in petroleum jelly for pregnant women/infants or oral Ivermectin if extensive infection. All clothing, bedding, etc should be placed in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours then wanted and dried using heat.Hint: Lindane is cheaper but not first choice. DO NOT use after bath/shower (may cause seizures due to increased absorption through open pores).Hint: Griseoflilvin is an antifungal. It can treat fungal infections such as ringworm, ""jock itch,"" and athlete's foot.Hint: topical Clindamycin is used for mild hydradenitis supperativa Intensely pruritic lesions: Intense pruritus with minimal skin findings increased intensity at night*. What is the treatment of choice? A) LindaneB) Permethrin topicalC) GriseoflilvinD) topical Clindamycin B) Permethrin topicalThe patient has Scabies. Red, itchy, prupritic papules or nodules on the scrotum, glans, or penile shaft, body fold is PATHOGNOMONIC for scabies. 14 year old boy presents with red, itchy, papules and nodules on his scrotum. What is the treatment?A) LindaneB) Permethrin topicalC) GriseoflilvinD) topical Clindamycin C) Renal artery stenosisSecondary HTN accounts for 5% of HTN and is due to an underlying and often correctable cause. Suspect Secondary HTN if blood pressure is refractory to antihypertensives or is severely elevated What is the MC cause of secondary hypertension?A) ETOHB) Oral ContraceptivesC) Renal artery stenosisD) Sleep Apnea B) VerapamilBeta blockers or Non-Dihydropyridine Calcium Channel blockers are first line to also provide rate control. Optimum therapy for Hypertension in patient with atrial fibrillation.A) LisinopriB) VerapamilC) FurosemideD) Losartan C) AmlodipineBeta blocker or calcium channel blockers Optimum therapy for hypertension on patient with anginaA) Lisinopril (Zestril)B) Furosemide (Lasix)C) Amlodipine (Norvasc)D) Losartan (Cozaar) A) Terazosin alpha-1 blockers. May cause 1st dose syncope, dizziness, headache, and/or weakness. Not used as 1st line. Optimum therapy for hypertension in patient with BPHA) Terazosin (Hytrin)B) Furosemide (Lasix)C) Amlodipine (Norvasc)D) Losartan (Cozaar) Optimum therapy for hypertension in an African-American patient. A) SpironolactoneB) AtenololC) HCTZD) Captopril D) Amlodipine (Norvasc)Use a CCB. Note: Losartan is the only ARB that doesn't cause hyperuricemia (so it can be safely used) Optimum therapy for hypertension in a patient with GoutA) Spironolactone (Aldactone)B) HCTZ (Microzide)C) Atenolol (Tenormin)D) Amlodipine (Norvasc) B) HCTZ (Microzide)Thiazides lower urinary calcium excretion.

Losartan is the only ARB that doesn't cause hyperuricemia (so it can be safely used) Which could you use for hypertension in your patient with Gout?A) Losartan (Cozaar)B) Enalapril (Vasotec)C) Furosemide (Lasix)D) HCTZ (Microzide) Cardioprotecitve, synergystic effect when used with thiazided in treating hypertensionA) ARBsB) ACEIC) CCBsD) Beta Blockers B) Topical tretinoinTopical retinoids, such as tretinoin, adapalene, and tazarotene, are effective first-line treatments for mild acne. Tretinoin is a comedolytic, which inhibits follicular canal obstruction by normalizing keratinocyte shedding, thereby inhibiting microcomedone formation. It also has anti-inflammatory properties. Adapalene has anti-inflammatory effects and normalizes follicular cell differentiation. The clinical presentation is that of acne vulgaris. Acne is a common skin condition that affects the pilosebaceous units. It usually begins in adolescence, though it also affects adults, especially women. Acne can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe. In mild acne, there are comedones, a few papules, and pustules without any nodules. In cases of moderate acne, patients have comedones, several papules and pustules, and a few nodules. In cases of severe acne, there are numerous comedones, papules, pustules, and nodules. Other topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide, topical sulfacetamide, and topical azelaic acid, are also effective first-line treatments for mild acne. Topical antibiotics, like erythromycin and clindamycin, are used in mild-to-moderate inflammatory acne because they have anti-inflammatory properties in addition to being effective against P. acnes. Benzoyl peroxide and topical antibiotics combinations reduce antibiotic resistance. A 16-year-old Caucasian girl presents with a 6-month history of blackheads and whiteheads on her face. On examination, you find a few papules and pustules on her cheeks; there are no nodules. Her mother reports that she had similar spots on her face before she got married. What is an appropriate first-line medication for her?A) Oral isotretinoinB) Topical tretinoinC) Oral doxycyclineD) Oral minocyclineE) Intralesional triamcinolone A) Blood culture positive for S.typhiDefinitive diagnosis depends on a positive blood culture for Salmonella typhi. The term Enteric fever includes typhoid caused by Salmonella enterica serotype, Typhi (referred to as S.typhi), and paratyphoid caused by Salmonella paratyphi A, B, and C. Isolation of S.typhi from stool and urine samples helps diagnosis, but could be positive in carriers as well. A 26-year-old man residing in Thailand presents with high-grade fever, dull, frontal headache, malaise, anorexia, and vague abdominal discomfort of 7 days duration. He had mild diarrhea, dry cough, and myalgia. On examination, his temperature was 39 degrees C. His pulse was 65 per minute. He had a coated tongue, tender abdomen, and a soft palpable spleen. Clinical diagnosis was Enteric fever. Appropriate clinical samples were sent for culture and serology. What laboratory data would be helpful in making a A) Blood culture positive for S.typhiB) Stool culture positive for S.typhiC) Urine culture positive for S.typhiD) Serum titer of S.typhi O agglutinins 1: 80E) Serum titer of S.typhi H agglutinins 1: 160 B) Dilated cardiomyopathyThe cause of the patient's dyspnea and fatigue is dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is caused by diminished cardiac contractility secondary to myocyte destruction.1 Multiple conditions can result in the death of the myocytes including chronic alcohol abuse and ischemia.1 The findings of an elevated BNP, cardiomegaly on CXR with decreased contractility, left ventricular enlargement, and systolic dysfunction on echo provide the diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy. A 58-year-old man with a history of alcoholism presents with a 3-week history of dyspnea and fatigue. He has not seen a medical provider in multiple years and has no known medical diagnoses. He takes no daily medications. Work up reveals a normal troponin, elevated BNP, lateral T wave inversion on EKG, and evidence of cardiomegaly on CXR. You order a stat echo, which shows enlarged left ventricle and systolic heart failure evidenced by decreased contractility. What is the most likely cause of the patient's dyspnea and fatigue?A) Acute myocardial infarctionB) Dilated cardiomyopathyC) Acute pericarditisD) Cardiac ischemiaE) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease A) Hepatocellular carcinomaThis patient has signs and symptoms consistent with , which is associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Hemochromatosis is due to an increase in iron within the tissues. Hemochromatosis is a disorder of iron overload; it could be due to genetic or non-genetic causes. In hereditary hemochromatosis, there is absorption of a few milligrams of iron each day, in excess of need. As such, clinical manifestations often occur only after the age of 40 years, when body iron stores have reached 15 to 40 g. The symptoms of hemochromatosis are nonspecific and include arthralgia; abdominal pain; fatigue, weakness; impotence; weight loss; amenorrhea and early menopause; abnormal skin pigmentation; damage to the pancreas leading to diabetes; cardiomyopathy; and cirrhosis. The liver is commonly affected with hemochromatosis, and hepatosplenomegaly is commonly seen. There is an abnormal skin pigmentation that is seen with hemochromatosis. In hemochromatosis, the plasma iron will be elevated; total iron binding capacity will be normal or low; and transferrin saturation will be elevated. Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most serious complication, and it is a major cause of death in patients with hemochromatosis. A large percentage of patients with hemochromatosis will develop problems with their pancreas; however, the pancreatic pathology commonly seen with hemochromatosis is insulin dependent diabetes, not pancreatic cancer. A 50-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of weakness, fatigue, and abdominal discomfort. Upon further questioning, he acknowledges a lack of sexual desire. He denies any photosensitivity. On physical examination, his liver is enlarged, and his spleen is palpable. He has abnormal skin pigmentation on his face, neck and his elbows and which gives his skin a . His laboratory results are in the chart. What serious complication is associated with the patient's condition?A) Hepatocellular carcinomaB) Bronchogenic carcinomaC) Pancreatic carcinomaD) LymphomaE) Leukemia A) Ethambutol Ethambutol can cause optic neuritis resulting in decreased visual acuity and possible blindness. The medication should be discontinued immediately at the first sign of visual loss. Because of the difficulty in monitoring vision in children, ethambutol is not recommended in this population. Side effects of isoniazid (B) include hepatitis and peripheral neuropathy, the latter of which can be prevented with coadministration of pyridoxine. Pyrazinamide (C) may cause hepatotoxicity and polyarthralgias. Rifampin (D) causes an orange discoloration of body fluids, including urine, tears, sweat and sputum. A 46-year-old man presents with right eye pain and a change in his vision. He was recently diagnosed with tuberculosis and started on a 4-drug regimen. Based on his history and physical exam findings, you are concerned for optic neuritis. Which of the following medications is likely responsible for his symptoms? A) Ethambutol B) IsoniazidC) PyrazinamideD) Rifampin B) Draw blood cultures and admit for intravenous antibiotics and transthoracic echoThis patient's presentation is and should have a minimum of three blood cultures drawn, started on intravenous antibiotics and ordered for a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).Although the patient has a predominance of respiratory features, the presence of fever and IVDA makes endocarditis a distinct possibility and the patient should not be discharged with the diagnosis of a respiratory infection (A). Valvuloplasty (C) uses a balloon catheter to open a stenotic valve. This is most often performed for aortic stenosis. Although this patient may one day require a valvuloplasty, it is not performed in the early stages of endocarditis. Fever, cough and chest pain may be consistent with pneumonia and early in the clinical course, the chest X-ray may not reveal an infiltrate. However, this patient is at high-risk for infective endocarditis and treatment for pneumonia (D) would not be appropriate. A 21-year-old woman with a history of intravenous drug abuse presents with fever, dyspnea, cough and chest pain. Examination reveals an ill-appearing woman with track marks on both upper extremities. A chest X-ray reveals no infiltrate and urinalysis is unremarkable. What management is indicated?A) Discharge with a prescription for azithromycin for a respiratory infectionB) Draw blood cultures and admit for intravenous antibiotics and transthoracic echoC) Draw blood cultures and admit for intravenous antibiotics and valvuloplastyD) Start antibiotics for community acquired pneumonia and admit All are manifestations of left-sided endocarditis. Roth spots are retinal hemorrhages and Osler nodes are painful nodes on the digits both caused by immunologic vasculitis. C) Pneumocystis pneumoniaHint: TB not the answer because the sputum cytology was negative for acid-fast bacilli.Hint: would present as a , (wart-like, moist lesions involving mucous membranes and other moist areas, especially near the chancre site and systemic symptoms,fever, lymphadenopathy, arthritis, meningitis, headache, and/or hepatitisHint: typically does not show diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrates. It would typically manifest with cough, hemoptysis, dyspnea, anorexia and weight loss. Might see hypercalcemia (especially with SCC), may see SIADH, Cushing's (ectopic ACTH MC with small cell); Lambert-Eaton Syndrome (Small cell - weakness similar to myasthenia gravis but with continued use); or Pancoast SyndromeHint: Legionella presents in immunocompromised, smokers, or chronic lung disease, scant sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, toxic appearnce, , with on gram stain of sputum. A 35-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath, fever, and worsening cough. The patient had been in good health until 2 months ago, when he began losing weight. This was associated with anorexia, intermittent diarrhea, night sweats, and then a nonproductive cough. He had lost more than 20 pounds by the time he was admitted to the hospital. His past medical history is unremarkable. He has been divorced for 5 years, and he has 1 child. He is employed as a medical equipment salesman, traveling extensively in the Midwest. He admits to drinking alcohol in large amounts on weekends, but he denies tobacco and intravenous drug use. He gives history of a previous homosexual encounter. Physical examination shows that the chest was normal to percussion and clear by auscultation, except for a few scattered ronchi. The heart is normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds. Genitalia are normal; however, there is a painful 2 cm ulceration at the anal verge. The neurologic exam is unremarkable. Chest radiological findings show . Arterial blood gases on room air show pO2- 57mmHg, pCO2 31 mmHg, and pH 7.45. His alveolar-arterial O2 gradient is 55mmHg. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with lung biopsy shows the presence of cysts. Sputum cytology is . What is the most likely diagnosis?A) AIDS-related tuberculosisB) Secondary syphilisC) Pneumocystis pneumoniaD) Lung cancerE) Legionella pneumonia C) Pneumocystis pneumoniaWhenever a young patient presents with fever, progressive exertional dyspnea, hypoxia, and loss of weight, the possibility of Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia complicating acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) should be considered, especially when diffuse interstitial infiltration (or patchy shadows) are found on chest radiological study. The history of a homosexual encounter favors this diagnosis. This should be followed by tests to confirm HIV. The increased alveolar-arterial O2 gradient indicates severe respiratory dysfunction. Bronchoalveolar lavage with lung biopsy is an appropriate early step in his evaluation. Finding pneumocystic cysts in the alveolar lavage is a confirmatory diagnosis for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Treatment is based on the alveolar-arterial O2 gradient, which is considered mild when the value is less than 35mmHg, moderate when it is 35-45mmHg, and severe disease when more than 45mmHg. The mainstay of treatment is given intravenously or orally. Combined therapy of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids is necessary in the treatment of a severe case of pneumocystis in AIDS. Administration of corticosteroids helps to prevent respiratory failure and death in AIDS patients. When Pneumocystis jiroveci Pneumonia is found in the absence of underlying immunosuppression from malignancy or drug, the patient fulfills the definition of AIDS. A 35-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with progressive shortness of breath, fever, and worsening cough. The patient had been in good health until 2 months ago, when he began losing weight. This was associated with anorexia, intermittent diarrhea, night sweats, and then a nonproductive cough. He had lost more than 20 pounds by the time he was admitted to the hospital. His past medical history is unremarkable. He has been divorced for 5 years, and he has 1 child. He is employed as a medical equipment salesman, traveling extensively in the Midwest. He admits to drinking alcohol in large amounts on weekends, but he denies tobacco and intravenous drug use. He gives history of a previous homosexual encounter. Physical examination shows that the chest was normal to percussion and clear by auscultation, except for a few scattered ronchi. The heart is normal except for tachycardia. The abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds. Genitalia are normal; however, there is a painful 2 cm ulceration at the anal verge. The neurologic exam is unremarkable. Chest radiological findings show . Arterial blood gases on room air show pO2- 57mmHg, pCO2 31 mmHg, and pH 7.45. His alveolar-arterial O2 gradient is 55mmHg. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with lung biopsy shows the presence of cysts. Sputum cytology is . What is the most likely diagnosis?A) AIDS-related tuberculosisB) Secondary syphilisC) Pneumocystis pneumoniaD) Lung cancerE) Legionella pneumonia C) Excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoidThe clinical case described most likely represents a patient with a thrombosed external hemorrhoid. External hemorrhoidal thrombosis is not infrequent and can be seen in patients with no prior history of hemorrhoidal disease. The cause is thought to be from elevated venous pressures related to excess straining with constipation and physical exertion following a bout of diarrhea or change in diet. It is an acute painful event with the pain generally lasting 7-14 days and resolving with resolution of the thrombosis. The clinical presentation is usually as described above, with acute swelling and pain located at or around the anal verge. When the overlying skin of the thrombosed hemorrhoid is eroded, bleeding occurs. The pain usually lasts for a few days and then spontaneously resolves. The swelling may take several weeks to resolve. Treatment depends on the time of presentation and the severity of the condition. Acute thrombosed external hemorrhoid presenting within 72 hours of onset of symptoms should be excised. Excision of the thrombosed external hemorrhoid can be performed under local anesthesia and is associated with a low recurrence and complication rate. Patients presenting after 72 hours of onset of symptoms should be managed by conservative/symptomatic medical therapy. A 45-year-old man presents with a 24-hour history of severe anal pain and swelling. The pain started after straining at defecation and has worsened over the course of the day. There is no history of fever. Examination of the anal area reveals a swollen ecchymotic mass in the perianal skin, very close to the anal verge. What is the treatment of choice for this condition?A) Immediate surgical drainage in the operating roomB) AntibioticsC) Excision of thrombosed external hemorrhoidD) Immediate colonoscopyE) Internal sphincterotomy E) Ethambutolhis patient has all the complaints and symptoms of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Direct sputum examination by Ziehl-Nielsen stain also helps the diagnosis, but it is still not confirmatory. Sputum needs to be cultured to check what kind of mycobacterium is causing this disease. It is important to start the treatment as soon as the culture is sent. The standard treatment for adult respiratory/pulmonary TB includes a complete 6-month regimen comprising of 2 months initial phase with 4 drugs, which include rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. This is followed by a 4-month continuation phase consisting of 2 drugs: rifampin and isoniazid. Irrespective of the bacteriological status of the sputum, this is the recommended standard treatment for respiratory tuberculosis (including isolated pleural effusion or mediastinal lymphadenopathy). The 4th drug, ethambutol, may be omitted in patients with a low risk of resistance to isoniazid. Ethambutol should be started in individuals who are known or suspected to be HIV positive, in those who have had previous treatment, and in immigrants and refugees of any ethnic group who are considered to have a significantly higher risk of resistance to isoniazid and other drugs. Like most medications, antituberculosis drugs also have some side effects. Since treatment is long-term, it is essential that patients are warned about and checked for side effects. If side effects are not explained well to the patient, it will decrease the compliance. The adverse effect of ethambutol is retrobulbar neuritis. The important side effects of anti-tubercular drugs are: INH: Hepatotoxicity, peripheral neuritis, cutaneous hypersensitivity, rarely can cause optic neuritis RMP: Hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, red discoloration of the body fluids, 'Flu-syndrome,' and thrombocytopenic purpura PZA: Hepatotoxicity, hyperuricemia ETH: Retrobulbar neuritis STM: Nephrotoxicity, ototoxicity A 30-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of coughing and a 2-day history of coughing blood. He has been losing weight and sweating at night. On physical examination, the patient appears wasted, tachypneic, has bronchial breath sounds on the right upper lobe, and crepitations on the left upper lobe and right mid zone. His direct sputum result comes back positive for acid-fast bacilli with Ziehl-Neelsen stain. His sputum is sent for culture, and treatment is started. Refer to the image. Retrobulbar neuritis is the predominant adverse effect of what drug? A) IsoniazidB) RifampinC) PyrazinamideD) StreptomycinE) Ethambutol A) KyphosisKyphosis is a posterior convex angulation of the thoracic spine as evaluated on a side view. Excessive and exaggerated angulation results in cosmetic problems, back pain, and cardio-respiratory problems. Kyphosis may be post-traumatic or non-traumatic type. Scheuermann's kyphosis, postural, congenital, and metabolic bone disease are a few of the non-traumatic causes of kyphosis. 13-year-old girl presents for her school physical. On examination, you notice the posterior curvature of her thoracic spine to be very prominent and bulging backward. What type of deformity of the spine does she have? A) KyphosisB) ScoliokyphosisC) ScoliosisD) LordosisE) Gibbus B) MicroalbuminuriaMicroalbuminuria is the first sign of diabetic nephropathy. Screening for microalbuminuria, a marker of kidney disease, is recommended annually for patients with type I diabetes of greater than 5 years duration; it is recommended annually for all patients with type II diabetes. This screening test is most easily obtained with a first void morning urine ""spot"" albumin to creatinine ratio. Normal levels for spot samples are <10 mg/g for men and <15 mg/g for women. Since kidney diseases other than diabetic kidney disease may cause proteinuria and albuminuria, evaluating the urine sediment of diabetics with presumed diabetic kidney disease is advised. Normal = <10Micro = 20-200Macro = >200Nephrotic = >3000 A 45-year-old woman with a 25-year history of type I diabetes presents for follow-up of her diabetes. Her spot albumin/creatinine ratio was 100 mg/g 4 months ago, and it was confirmed at 100 mg/g yesterday. Her urinary analysis shows no cells, casts, or blood. Her creatinine is 0.7mg/dl, and her estimated glomerular filtration rate is 95 ml/min/1.73m2. How would her proteinuria be described?A) NormoalbuminuriaB) MicroalbuminuriaC) MinialbuminuriaD) MacroalbuminuriaE) Nephrotic syndrome C) LisinoprilLisinopril, an ACE Inhibitor, should help decrease albuminuria, prevent progression of diabetic kidney disease from micro to macroalbuminuria, and prevent a decline in glomerular filtration rate. This class of medications has been studied extensively for these purposes. Angiotensin II receptor blockers (e.g., irbesartan) may also reduce urinary albumin to normal levels. Monotherapy with either of these classes of medications should be attempted first in patients with microalbuminuria. This will test tolerance, effectiveness, and adverse reaction such as hyperkalemia. For patients with greater degrees of albuminuria (e.g., 1 g/day), poor response to monotherapy and blood pressure control, and no hyperkalemia associated with therapy, combination therapy should be considered. Combination therapy with both ACE inhibitors (e.g., lisinopril) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (e.g., irbesartan) is used to treat both diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease. These medications act on different parts of the renin angiotensin system. In combination, irbesartan could block the effect of angiotensin produced by non-ACE pathways and lisinopril could block the production of angiotensin stimulated by irbesartan in a negative feedback system; however, combination therapy is usually preceded by monotherapy. Although combination therapy is currently being used in both diabetic and non-diabetic kidney disease, this therapy still being researched. It is unknown whether monotherapy alone is sufficient. It does not appear to be sufficient in all patients, particularly those with persistent micro and macroalbuminuria despite monotherapy. A 55-year-old woman with a 15-year history of type II diabetes presents for follow-up of her diabetes. Her spot albumin/creatinine ratio was 100 mg/g 4 months ago and was confirmed at 100 mg/g yesterday. Her urinary analysis shows no cells, casts, or blood. Her creatinine is 0.7mg/dl and her estimated glomerular filtration rate is 95 ml/min/1.73m2. What medication(s) should you prescribe to help prevent her progression from micro to macroalbuminuria and to help prevent a progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate?A) Potassium chlorideB) Calcium carbonateC) LisinoprilD) Sodium bicarbonateE) Calcium citrate A) AsthmaThe spirometry result in this patient shows reduction in both forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), but FEV1 is more affected than FVC. Therefore, there is a decrease in the FEV1/FVC ratio below the predicted levels. The TLC is normal (80-120%). This concludes that this is an obstructive disorder and excludes the restrictive diseases listed. There is a marked improvement with bronchodilators. In reversible airway obstruction such as in asthma, there is a rise in the FEV1 and/or FVC by approximately 12% from pre- to post-bronchodilator testing. This reversibility is characteristic of bronchial asthma. The spirometry findings are not suggestive of restrictive lung diseases such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, kyphoscoliosis, and tuberculosis. A 7-year-old boy presents with a 1-week history of wheezing and dyspnea on any exertion (with productive cough). On physical examination, bilateral rhonchi are heard. After a few days of treatment, spirometry is done on the patient. The findings are shown in the table. Total lung capacity (TLC) is 111% on spirometry. What is the most likely diagnosis?A) AsthmaB) PneumoniaC) Pleural effusionD) KyphoscoliosisE) Tuberculosis A) ImmediatelyBreast cancer is recognized as both an increasingly common disorder and a potentially hereditary disorder. Furthermore, early detection will provide a woman with her best chance at a cure of breast cancer. Given the patient's genetic burden of having both her mother and her grandmother die of metastatic breast cancer at the relatively young age of 32 years, it is reasonable to provide her with immediate and periodic mammography combined with instruction in breast self-examination. Women at high risk require a more aggressive schedule, frequent examinations, and other procedures such as ultrasound and MRI. American Cancer Society Guidelines- Women ages 40 to 44 should have the choice to start annual breast cancer screening with mammograms if they wish to do so.- Women age 45 to 54 should get mammograms every year- Women 55 and older should switch to mammograms every 2 years or can continue yearly screening.- Screening should continue as long as a woman is in good health and is expected to live 10 more years or longer.The ACS does not recommend clinical breast examination for breast cancer screening among average-risk women at any ageACOG continues to recommend adherence to its current guidelines, which include the following:- Screening mammography every 1-2 years for women aged 40-49 years- Screening mammography every year for women aged 50 years or older A 29-year-old woman inquires when she should have her first mammogram. Her family history is significant for the death of her mother and grandmother due to breast cancer at the age of 32 years. Presently, the woman is asymptomatic. What is the recommendation for mammography for this patient? If you have a strong family history, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network recommends, starting at age 30, you get a:- Clinical breast exam every 6-12 months- Mammogram every year- Breast MRI every yearA) ImmediatelyB) When she is 30 years oldC) When she is 32 years oldD) When she is 34 years oldE) When she is 36 years old A) MyxedemaMyxedema is one of the metabolic predisposing causes for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient's clinical presentation is suggestive of carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a median nerve compressive neuropathy. Patients with myxedema or hypothyroidism have accumulation of myxedemateous tissue under the transverse carpal ligament, which causes compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel resulting in the manifestations of carpal tunnel syndrome. In carpal tunnel syndrome the median nerve is compressed in the wrist. The neurological distribution of her complaints corresponds to the distribution of the median nerve. The median nerve innervates the palmar surface of the thumb, index, middle, and radial half of the ring fingers and the motor branch innervates the thenar muscles. Electromyography and nerve conduction studies help in confirming the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Patients can be managed with analgesics for pain, corticosteroids which can be administered orally or as local injection, and splint to prevent wrist flexion and further compression of the carpal tunnel. The other metabolic causes of carpal tunnel syndrome include acromegaly, diabetes mellitus, and amyloidosis. None of the other choices listed, which include hypoadrenalism, hypoprolactinemia, hypoglycemia, and Cushing syndrome, are associated with an increase in the occurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome. A 42-year-old woman works full-time as a data entry clerk and often puts in many hours of overtime. She has started to notice numbness and tingling in her right thumb, index finger, middle finger, and half of her ring finger; symptoms are especially severe at night The numbness and tingling were intermittent for months, but they have become persistent during the past few days. What could be considered a predisposing factor for this patient's condition? A) MyxedemaB) HypoadrenalismC) HypoprolactinemiaD) HypoglycemiaE) Cushing syndrome B) Serum Iron testA teenager who comes in frequently for a viral upper respiratory infection is a typical patient in any ambulatory practice. In many cases, the frequent infections can result from the busy lifestyles that many teenagers have. High school students are often involved in many extracurricular activities, miss sleep, and frequently obtain a less-than-nutritious diet. In this case, the physician ordering the tests has uncovered another reason for this young woman's frequent viral illnesses: subclinical iron deficiency. The patient's CBC demonstrates a borderline low hematocrit, which may be passed for normal. Her MCV is on the low edge of normal, suggesting microcytosis. Both these values suggest that this patient may suffer from subclinical iron deficiency, as her hematocrit is not overtly low. Iron deficiency on its own can lead to reversible abnormalities of immune function. Subclinical iron deficiency is diagnosed on the basis of reduced serum ferritin, decreased transferrin saturation, and decreased serum iron levels; however, normal hemoglobin has also been documented to impair immune responsiveness. In areas with prevalent nutritional deficiencies, milk fortification reduces morbidity due to respiratory disease. Although there have been conflicting reports on the value of iron supplementation in the prevention of infection, it appears that iron supplementation may benefit children with iron deficiency if they reside in a non-malarious region. A 16-year-old girl presents for the third time in 2 months with symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection. She has a blocked nose, tearing eyes, and appears exhausted. The first 2 times, she presented the same way and the diagnosis was a viral upper respiratory infection. At the 2nd presentation, she was given antibiotics in the vain hope that there was a superimposed sinus bacterial infection. When she presents the 3rd time, her mother comes in with her and demands to know what is making her daughter so susceptible to viral infections. The patient is a high school student and has a heavy study load. 2 months ago, she was studying for finals, and everyone believed the stress of exams was the cause of her illness. This time, she has been sick for 3 days with a bad cough, fever, runny nose, and throat pain; she denies that she has been overworked and says that she eats a good diet. On exam, you observe temperature 100.9°F; pulse 92 bpm; RR 18/min; BP 120/80 mm Hg. The head/ear/throat exam is unrevealing; the lung and heart exam is within normal limits. Her laboratory data reveals: What test is indicated at this time?A) Throat cultureB) Serum Iron testC) Serum Immunoglobulin levelsD) Folate levelE) No test is indicated at this time C) The condition is most common after 40 years of ageDysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is a condition of irregular uterine bleeding in a patient who does not have an anatomic uterine lesion. It is most common above the age of 40 years (50% of the cases), but it is also seen in adolescents (20%), in whom it is associated with anovulatory cycles. Anovulatory cycles are characterized by abnormal levels of estrogen and may be due to estrogen withdrawal or breakthrough. A deteriorating ovarian follicular function is responsible for anovulatory bleeding during the climacteric. Other etiologies, such as polycystic ovarian disease, fibroids, and thyroid disease need to be ruled out before making the diagnosis. An endometrial biopsy or dilation and curettage (if the patient cannot undergo an endometrial biopsy in the office) can be diagnostic, but it is not curative or even therapeutic in a patient with DUB. Medical therapy, including estrogens, progestational agents, progesterone-impregnated intrauterine devices, and combination oral contraceptives are used to treat the condition. A 42-year-old gravida 1, para 1 presents with a 4-month history of menorrhagia. She is having shortened menstrual cycles that are sometimes only 15 days in length, with menstrual bleeding for 5 - 6 days. She is using approximately 12 - 14 pads or tampons per day. She admits to fatigue, headaches, and occasional dizziness, but denies syncope. There is no dysmenorrhea. A thyroid-stimulating test last month was within normal limits. Abdominal and pelvic exams are normal. What statement is true regarding dysfunctional uterine bleeding?A) It is seen in all age groups equallyB) Dilatation and curettage is the only treatmentC) The condition is most common after 40 years of ageD) The condition is not seen in adolescentsE) It is never associated with ovulatory cycles D) Administer sodium bicarbonateThe patient has taken amitriptyline, which is a tricarboxylic acid antidepressant (TCA); her set of symptoms are consistent with TCA toxicity. The mechanisms of action of TCA are via anticholinergic effects, norepinephrine reuptake blockade, a quinidine effect, a sodium channel blocker, and peripheral alpha blockade. TCA-cardiotoxicity may be demonstrated on an electrocardiogram via sinus tachycardia, QRS complex prolongation > 100 milliseconds, right bundle branch block, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and QT prolongation. Sodium bicarbonate is the drug of choice for the treatment of ventricular dysrhythmias and/or hypotension, secondary to tricarboxylic acid antidepressant (TCA) poisoning. A 33-year-old woman presents after being found unresponsive in the bedroom of her home. She has a past medical history of depression, and her mother found an by her bedside. Otherwise, she has no other medical or surgical history. The patient is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. On physical exam, her pulse is 138/minute, blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg, temperature is 101.2°F (38.4°C), and respirations 6/minute. Her heart sounds are normal and she has thready pulses. Her breath sounds are normal, but with shallow effort. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Neurologically, she moves her limbs from painful stimuli. Her skin is flushed with no needle marks. Her chest X-ray is normal, and the electrocardiogram demonstrates a wide complex tachycardia without ectopy. The patient is intubated and hyperventilated. What is the t* appropriate step of the patient's management?A) Administer intravenous lactated Ringer's solutionB) Administer phenytoinC) Administer physostigmineD) Administer sodium bicarbonateE) Hemodialysis E) Admit patient, start humidified oxygen and intermittent racemic epinephrineThis is respiratory distress secondary to croup cuased by parainfluenza virus.This child is in acute respiratory distress as depicted by her stridor at rest, nasal flaring, and state of distress. The situation warrants admission, treatment, and careful observation. Corticosteroids via nebulizer may also be effective. Specific antiviral treatments and parainfluenza vaccines are not currently available. Parainfluenza virus will not respond to antibiotic treatment. Although home care with a vaporizer can be effective for patients with milder cases of croup, this child is severely ill. A 3-year-old girl presents with a 2-day history of sore throat and fever. This morning, she was hoarse and seemed to be having more difficulty breathing. On exam, she appears to be in distress and has an oral temperature of 100.0 F. Tympanic membranes are pink but not bulging. Nares are patent without rhinorrhea. She has a barking cough, stridor at rest, and nasal flaring. What treatment is most appropriate in the care of this child?A) Start specific antiviral therapyB) Start broad spectrum antibioticC) Administer parainfluenza vaccineD) Discharge home to use cool mist vaporizerE) Admit patient, start humidified oxygen and intermittent racemic epinephrine B) Tenderness over the AC (acromioclavicular) jointAcromioclavicular (AC) separations typically occur as a result of a direct blow to the very lateral shoulder, usually a fall onto the shoulder. This AC separation is probably a Type I. Type I will have tenderness over the AC joint, no deformity and fair motion with some pain but the patient may still be able to play football with the shoulders padded and limited contact. Pain occurs with abduction mainly. They will typically hold their arm adducted and supported. Tenderness over the greater tuberosity would be seen with rotator cuff pathology or proximal humerus fractures. Crepitus would be seen with fracture or Type III AC separations. Nerve and/or vascular injuries are very rare with this injury. A 17-year-old male high school football player presents after being tackled and slammed onto his right dominant shoulder forcefully 2 hours ago during a game. He had immediate pain, but was able to continue punting. He has full active and passive range of motion, but some pain (4/10) with abduction. There is no obvious deformity and the skin over the shoulder is intact and not tented. What would you expect to find on a physical exam?A) Tenderness over the greater tuberosityB) Tenderness over the AC (acromioclavicular) jointC) Crepitus with motionD) Decreased radial pulseE) Paresthesia over the elbow D) Anterior/Posterior (AP) and axillary or transscapular lateral radiographsAP and axillary lateral or transscapular lateral (Y-scapula) views should be obtained. It is imperative that a lateral view of the shoulder joint be obtained to assess the position of the humeral head. Posterior dislocations can be easily missed if the lateral view is not obtained. A 19-year-old man presents with pain and deformity of his right dominant shoulder after a sudden jerking movement to the same from a wrestling competitor approximately 1 hour ago. He states he felt a clunking sensation when it happened. He was unable to continue wrestling and has pain with movement of the right shoulder. What diagnostic studies should be performed?A) MRI statB) CT of the shoulderC) Anterior/Posterior (AP) and internally rotated humeral view radiographsD) Anterior/Posterior (AP) and axillary or transscapular lateral radiographsE) Internal and external rotated views of the humeral head D) MRIThis elderly man probably has a torn rotator cuff. If surgical treatment is being considered, MRI is the imaging study of choice because it can provide additional information on the status of the muscle and the size of the rotator cuff tear. Electromyelogram is used to assess the nerves. Ultrasound doesn't give as clear a picture of the tear due to the bony interference. Plain films can assess only the boney picture. A 73-year-old man presents with the inability to actively raise his left non-dominant arm to retrieve plates from the kitchen cabinet. This began a month ago after his shoulder pain improved. He had a history of pain in that shoulder for over 6 months that kept him from sleeping on the left side and the pain would wake him often. There was no specific injury he can recall although he felt a pop a month ago while taking out the trash. What is the diagnostic study of choice if surgery is indicated? A) CT without contrastB) Electromyelogram (EMG)C) UltrasoundD) MRIE) Plain films A) ""What disturbs you about this behavior?""Before the physician can provide guidance for the parents, the parents' concerns need to be understood. While the described behavior is perfectly normal for a 5-year-old, and it is appropriate for parents to knock on the door of their child's room before entering to teach children respect for privacy through modeling, the parents' concerns must first be understood. To immediately assume there is something physically wrong with the child, or that the child has been sexually abused, suggests that the physician may have some personal issues with children's normal sexuality. The mother of a 5-year-old girl walks into her daughter's bedroom without knocking and discovers the girl stimulating her genitals. The girl's parents are concerned, but seem to be receptive to advice. What is the best response a physician could give?A) ""What disturbs you about this behavior?""B) ""Do you think that someone's been molesting her?""C) ""Don't you think you should knock before going into her room?""D) ""She probably has a vaginal infection. Bring her in so I can examine her.""E) ""This is not normal behavior for a child this age."" C) Malignant mesotheliomaHis work history predisposed him to asbestos. Mesothelioma can take more than 40 years to surface, and the most common industries that expose people to asbestos are construction, mining, brake linings, roofing, and working in shipyards. This patient worked in both construction and a car garage shop, which would have likely exposed him routinely to asbestos A 75-year-old man presents with a 4-month history of dyspnea on exertion and a productive cough. He also unintentionally lost 10 pounds in 2 months. His past medical history is significant for coronary artery disease and a myocardial infarction. He has smoked an occasional cigar the last few years. He has been retired for 12 years, but for 30 years he worked odd jobs in the construction industry. He also helped his father in the family's car garage shop. Vital signs are normal. His physical exam is remarkable for decreased breath sounds in left lower lung fields and dullness to percussion. A chest radiograph is ordered, and it shows a left sided pleural effusion. What condition does this patient have?A) Lung cancerB) Congestive heart failureC) Malignant mesotheliomaD) PneumoniaE) Recurrent postmyocardial infarction pericarditis E) Fasting prolactin, TSH, FSH, LH, hysterosalpingogramFasting prolactin, TSH, FSH, and LH should all be obtained in the female patient as her irregular menses more or less indicate a high probability of oligomenorrhea. It is also important to evaluate by hysterosalpingogram to look for evidence of uterine and/or tubal defects. It is also important to evaluate the male patient's semen to investigate male infertility related to oligospermia or hypomotility A 29-year-old woman, G0P0, and her husband present to your office after 1 year of infertility. Their histories elicit irregular menses in the woman and that the man is an avid cyclist. Apart from semen analysis in the man, what laboratory and/or diagnostic studies should be pursued in the woman to further evaluate this couple's infertility?A) Fasting prolactin, TSHB) TSH, LH, T3, T4C) Fasting prolactin, FSHD) FSH, T3, T4E) Fasting prolactin, TSH, FSH, LH, hysterosalpingogram D) NeovascularizationNeovascularization is the hallmark of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. New vessels can appear at the optic nerve and the macula as a result of retinal hypoxia. They are susceptible to rupture, resulting in vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and blindness. Proliferative retinopathy requires urgent referral to an ophthalmologist and is usually treated with pan retinal laser photocoagulation. The risk of developing diabetic retinopathy is related to the extent of glycemic control and the duration of diabetes. It is classified as nonproliferative and proliferative. Blot hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and microaneurysms are indicative of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, which is usually seen 10 to 20 years after the onset of diabetes. Nonproliferative retinopathy does not always progress to proliferative retinopathy, but if it becomes extensive, it can result in retinal ischemia, which increases the likelihood of proliferative disease. Flame-shaped hemorrhages are indicative of hypertensive retinopathy. A 44-year-old man presents for follow-up of poorly controlled type I diabetes mellitus, which was diagnosed 32 years ago. What change on his funduscopic examination would indicate a need for urgent referral to an ophthalmologist?A) Blot hemorrhagesB) Cotton wool spotsC) MicroaneurysmsD) NeovascularizationE) Flame-shaped hemorrhages A) Hypertrophic CardiomyopathyThe clinical picture is suggestive of a Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (HCM). The age of presentation is usually in the mid-20's and the most frequent symptom is dyspnea although most patients are asymptomatic with a normal physical examination. Syncope may result from an arrhythmia due to abnormal myofibers. The transient increase in LV size during squatting reduces the LV outflow tract obstruction in HCM and softens the intensity of the murmur. The increase in QRS voltage indicates a hypertrophied heart and, depending on which leads (V1-V6), will tell you right or left heart. In Aortic stenosis, the murmur will get louder with squatting and in this patient the murmur gets softer. Mitral valve stenosis produces a diastolic murmur, while there is a systolic murmur in this patient. Mitral valve insufficiency (MVI) does produce a systolic murmur but it is described as pansystolic and the patient with MVI could have symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, palpitations, and orthopnea which is not present in this patient. Pulmonary stenosis is rare and would produce signs of jugular venous distention (JVD), cyanosis of nail bed, and general symptoms of hypoxia. There is no mention of JVD or cyanosis in this patient. A 25-year-old woman presents to the ER after a syncopal episode. She had loss of consciousness 3 times over the past 12 months. Each event occurred during or just after physical exercise. On PE: BP 110/70 mm Hg, HR 75/min, normal S1/S2, and a III/VI systolic ejection murmur is heard best at the left sternal border that decreases with squatting. The EKG shows a normal sinus rhythm with diffuse increased QRS voltage. What is the most likely diagnosis?A) Hypertrophic CardiomyopathyB) Mild Mitral Valve InsufficiencyC) Moderate Pulmonary StenosisD) Severe Aortic StenosisE) Moderate Mitral Valve Stenosis C) Diabetes mellitusThe correct answer is diabetes mellitus since the presence of polyuria would indicate hyperglycemia and the associated erectile dysfunction and/or balanitis may be the only other presenting symptom or sign of diabetes mellitus in a male patient. Erectile dysfunction is a common vascular and neurological complication of diabetes and occurs in up to 75% of male diabetics. Elevated blood sugars result in autonomic neuropathy of the cavernous nerve of the penis so that erectile dysfunction serves as one of the earliest indications of neuropathy. Likewise, hyperglycemia results in microvascular damage to the dorsal and cavernous arteries, in the same way retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy develop, further contributing to poor perfusion and erectile dysfunction. Hyperglycemia also results in the colonization of skin organisms, commonly Candida, resulting in typical superficial yeast infections seen in diabetics such as balanitis in men and vulvovaginitis in women. A 66-year-old man presents to the office with polyuria and erectile dysfunction. He denies any other symptoms or significant past medical history. Physical examination reveals Tanner stage 5 of the external genitalia, balanitis of an uncircumcised penis, and slightly enlarged, symmetrical and smooth prostate. His condition is most likely the result of: A) Benign prostatic hypertrophyB) Diabetes insipidusC) Diabetes mellitusD) HypogonadismE) Prostate cancer C) 200 cells/mcL = TMP/SMX first; Dapsone, atovaquone, Pentamidine secondPrimary prophylaxis for pneumocystosis in a patient with HIV infection should be initiated when CD4 cells counts drop to 200 cells/mcL or less. When CD 4 levels drop to 50 cells/mcL, primary prophylaxis for mycobacterium avium complex should be initiated. The other cell counts listed are not levels at which primary prophylaxis should be initiated. A 30-year-old HIV-positive man presents to your clinic for the first time with a history of pneumocystosis, and he is on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for secondary prophylaxis. Primary prophylaxis of Pneumocystis pneumonia is recommended for patients at what CD4 cell count?A) 50 cells/mcLB) 100 cells/mcLC) 200 cells/mcLD) 350 cells/mcLE) 500 cells/mcL 150 cells /mcl = Itraconazole first, Ampho B second Primary prophylaxis of Histoplasmosis in HIV is recommended at what CD4 cell count? 100 cells/mcl = TMP/SMX first, Dapsone + Pyrimethamine + Folinic acid second Primary prophylaxis of Toxoplasmosis is recommended at what CD4 count? Primary prophylaxis of Cryptococcus is recommended at what CD4 count? 50 cells/mcl = Azithromycin or Clarithromcin first, Rifabutin second Primary prophylaxis of MAC is recommended at what CD4 count? 50 cells/mcl = Valganiciclovir first; ganciclocvir + foscarnet second Primary prophylaxis of CMV retinitis is recommended at what CD4 count? E) Polymerase Chain Reaction assay and antigen detectionhe characteristics presented by this child suggest B. pertussisor parapertussis infection. The diagnosis of pertussis is still primarily clinical, and laboratory results only play a small role in the diagnostics. Chest X-ray cannot confirm the suspected diagnosis. WBC count is likely to be elevated, with the lymphocytes composing 70 - 80% of the total count. The infection can be directly confirmed by culture for Bordetella pertussis, but it takes several days, and there is a high rate of false negative results. Immunofluorescent staining of nasopharyngeal washing can be done, and it is significantly more sensitive than culture. Although culture used to be the gold standard, PCR assay and antigen detection are now considered more reliable. PCR assay and antigen detection are increasingly used to assist in diagnosing pertussis. Advantages include greater sensitivity, more rapidly available results, and use later in the disease course or after antimicrobial therapy because the tests do not rely on the isolation of viable organisms. Their use is limited by lack of standardization and incomplete understanding of the correlation between test results and the course of the illness. A 5-year-old girl has paroxysms of cough that increase in severity and duration. Some coughing episodes are followed by a whooplike, high-pitched inspiratory noise, and vomiting has also occurred after paroxysms. What laboratory test could lead to the earliest confirmation of the likely diagnosis?A) Chest X-rayB) Blood cell analysisC) CultureD) Immunofluorescent antibody stainingE) Polymerase Chain Reaction assay and antigen detection C) 3 hoursTissue plasminogen activator (TPA) catalyzes the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, which promotes fibrinolysis. Ischemic stroke is caused by sudden occlusion of a cerebral artery by thrombus or embolus, producing a focal neurologic deficit. Timely reperfusion of ischemic brain tissue has been shown to limit irreversible neuronal injury in both humans and animals. The benefit of TPA in acute ischemic stroke was demonstrated in a large, multicentered national study. Patients whose symptoms began within 3 hours of treatment with TPA had significantly less disability at the end of 3 months than those given placebo. Although treated patients had higher incidence of secondary brain hemorrhage (6.4% vs. 0.8 %), there was no difference in mortality between the 2 groups. TPA must be given no later than 3 hours of symptom onset in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Prior to treatment, it is essential to exclude cerebral hemorrhage on a head CT scan. The presence of a bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled hypertension, recent prior stroke, and past history of cerebral hemorrhage are important contraindications for using TPA in acute ischemic stroke. TPA given later than 6 hours of stroke onset is associated with unacceptable risk of cerebral hemorrhage; it is not known whether fibrinolytic therapy can be given between 3 and 6 hours of stroke onset. What is the therapeutic window for using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator in acute ischemic stroke?A) 1 hourB) 2 hoursC) 3 hoursD) 4 hoursE) 6 hours A) CorticosteroidsFine serrations (ulcers) and pseudopolyps suggest ulcerative colitis. It is usually limited to the colon but occasionally, as in this case, the terminal ileum is also affected (""backwash"" ileitis). In addition to sulfasalazine or 5-amino-salicylacid, more severe ulcerative colitis cases require corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are also helpful in Crohn's disease involving the small bowel. Metronidazole is helpful in treating the characteristic fistulas of Crohn's disease. Immunosuppressive agents, like with 6-mercaptopurine, are used in severe Crohn's disease cases. Diphenoxylate and loperamide provide only symptomatic relief. While surgical removal of the colon can give relief in ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease tends to recur in about half of the cases involving removal of the diseased bowel. A 15-year-old boy develops bloody diarrhea with abdominal cramping. Double contrast barium enema shows fine serrations and narrowing of the rectum and sigmoid. Stool contains mucus, blood, and white blood cells, but no parasites or bacterial pathogens. Endoscopy shows inflamed mucosa and pseudopolyps. Biopsy finds extensive inflammatory process in the mucosa and submucosa. Glands are filled with eosinophilic secretions. There is also mild involvement of the terminal ileum. Sulfasalazine treatment was attempted but failed to bring improvement. What is the most appropriate next step in the management?A) CorticosteroidsB) MetronidazoleC) 6-mercaptopurineD) DiphenoxylateE) Loperamide B) If the fluid has a protein concentration below 3 g/dLAfter the diagnosis of ascites is made by physical examination, all patients with new-onset ascites should undergo abdominal paracentesis and ascitic fluid analysis. The most important tests to order for fluid analysis include protein concentration and cell count. Fluids with protein concentration above 3 g/dL are designated as exudates. Those with values below 3 g/dL are designated as transudates. Diseases usually associated with transudates include congestive heart failure, cirrhosis, constrictive pericarditis, inferior vena cava obstruction, hypoalbuminemia, Meigs syndrome, and some cases of nephrotic syndrome. The amount of albumin in the ascitic fluid compared to the serum albumin (the Serum Ascites Albumin Gradient, SAAG) can be indicative of the cause of ascites. Ascites related to hypertension, cirrhosis, or congestive heart failure generally shows a SAAG greater than 1.1 g/dL. Exudates are more commonly seen with peritoneal neoplasm, pancreatic ascites, myxedema, and tuberculous peritonitis. A large number of red blood cells in the fluid or grossly bloody ascites suggests a diagnosis of neoplasm. An acidic fluid and leukocyte count of more than 500/mm3 strongly suggests a peritoneal infection or inflammatory process. Other tests that should be ordered in the appropriate clinical setting include cytologic examination, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), specific tumor markers, glucose, and cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. A 55-year-old African-American man presents as febrile with massive swelling of the abdomen and diarrhea. He has a 20-year history of heavy alcohol use. A fluid wave is elicited on physical examination of the abdomen by striking one flank and feeling the transmitted wave on the opposite flank. In what case would ascitic fluid analysis suggest cirrhosis as a cause of ascites in this patient?A) If the acidic fluid and leukocyte count is more than 500/mm3B) If the fluid has a protein concentration below 3 g/dLC) If there is a large number of red blood cells in the fluidD) If fluid is designated as an exudateE) If the Serum Ascites Albumin Gradient is lower than 1.1 g/dL A) Direct inguinal herniaDirect inguinal hernia is correct because the direct inguinal hernia enters through the weakened abdominal fascia and into the anatomic region known as Hesselbach's Triangle. This area is bordered by the rectus abdominus, the inferior epigastric artery, and the inguinal ligament. Femoral hernias, indirect inguinal hernias, and umbilical hernias do not traverse through Hesselbach's triangle. There was no previous surgery for an incisional hernia to occur. A 50-year-old man presents with a lump in his groin for 2 weeks. He states he was lifting an air conditioner and he felt a pop in his groin and began to notice an outpouching in his lower abdomen that has become mildly tender over the last week. Resting and lying flat appears to help, and standing and lifting aggravates it. He denies any fevers, nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits. Patient denies any previous abdominal surgeries or procedures. Upon examination, you identify a soft, reducible mass in the lower abdomen and hernia examination reveals a mass pushing against the side of your finger. You order an ultrasound of the lower abdomen and find the intestinal sac has traversed through a weakened area of the abdominal wall and through Hesselbach's Triangle. This type of hernia is referred to as a(n)A) Direct inguinal herniaB) Femoral herniaC) Indirect inguinal herniaD) Umbilical herniaE) Incisional hernia A) Weber - sound is heard louder in right ear, Rinne - bone conduction exceeds air conduction in right ear = lateralization (middle of head). In unilateral conductive hearing loss, sound is heard in the impaired ear. In unilateral sensorineural, sound is heard in the good ear. = AC vs BC (mastoid then air/ear)Otitis media and serous otitis are examples of causes of conductive hearing loss. When a conductive hearing loss exists, the Weber test will result in the appearance of a louder sound in the affected ear and the Rinne test will result in bone conduction exceeding air conduction in the affected ear. The other answers are incorrect because in a sensorineural hearing loss, the Weber test results in a louder sound in the unaffected ear and the Rinne test will result in air conduction exceeding bone conduction in the affected ear. A 25-year-old man presents to you with an acute otitis media with serous otitis in the right ear. You perform the Weber and Rinne tests. Which of the following results would you most likely expect to find?A) Weber - sound is heard louder in right ear, Rinne - bone conduction exceeds air conduction in right earB) Weber - sound is heard louder in left ear, Rinne - bone conduction exceeds air conduction in right earC) Weber - sound is heard louder in right ear, Rinne - air conduction exceeds bone conduction in right earD) Weber - sound is heard louder in left ear, Rinne - air conduction exceeds air conduction in right earE) Weber - sound is equal in both ears, Rinne - bone conduction greater than air conduction in right ear D) Chronic bronchitishe clinical picture is suggestive of chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is defined by a clinical history of productive cough for 3 months of the year for 2 consecutive years. Smoking is the leading cause. The principle pathologic feature is airway injury and narrowing, hypertrophy of the airway mucous glands, infiltrate of inflammatory cells, and loss of ciliated epithelium. The cough produces thick, often purulent sputum because of the ongoing local inflammation and the high likelihood of bacterial colonization and infection. The increased mucous production and defective mucociliary escalator function leads to inspiratory and expiratory crackles. On imaging, common findings are hyperinflation of lung volumes, depressed diaphragm, and parallel linear densities known as tram track lines. Asthma produces wheezing lung sounds. They are not heard in this patient. A productive cough is not a clinical manifestation of emphysema. Pulmonary edema may present with mild exertional dyspnea or a nonproductive cough, although a frothy or blood-tinged sputum may be seen. Pulmonary fibrosis is a restrictive lung disease with the clinical features of progressive dyspnea. It is typically accompanied by a dry, persistent hacking cough. A 53-year-old woman presents with a 1-year history of chronic cough. The cough produces large volumes of grossly purulent sputum. She has a history of recurrent respiratory infections; they resulted in 5 hospitalizations in the past year. She also had similar complaints during the previous year.. Shortness of breath limits her daily activity considerably. Upon pulmonary examination, bilateral breath sounds are audible, with inspiratory and expiratory crackles at the lung bases. Chest X-rays reveal increased lung volumes, flattened diaphragm, and tram track lines. A) AsthmaB) EmphysemaC) Pulmonary edemaD) Chronic bronchitisE) Pulmonary fibrosis A 54-year-old woman presents with nervousness, a tremor, and irritability. She indicates that she has lost some weight over the last few weeks even though her appetite has increased. She also says that she is feeling feverish. You suspect that she may have a thyroid condition and order the appropriate labs. The lab results are as follows: What is the most likely diagnosis?A) Thyroid stormB) Pituitary adenomaC) Graves' DiseaseD) Hashimoto's thyroiditisE) Iodine deficiency C) Rest and NSAIDsThe clinical picture is suggestive of acute pericarditis. Most cases are due to viral infections with the treatment being rest and non-steroidal agents, e.g. aspirin or indomethacin. If this pericarditis progressed to tamponade, pericardiocentesis would be indicated. Symptoms of tamponade are not seen in this patient (dyspnea, elevated jugular venous pressure, hypotension, paradoxic pulse, and muffled heart sounds). Beta blockers are not indicated for treating pericarditis. Corticosteroids are usually given in cases unresponsive to rest and NSAIDs. Most cases of pericarditis are self-limiting and usually run their course from 1-3 weeks but initial treatment consists of rest and NSAIDs. A 39-year-old man presents with a 1-week history of severe chest pain. He states that the pain seems to worsen when he lies down. He describes the pain as radiating to the back, and it also worsens when he takes a deep breath. His vital signs are as follows: blood pressure 124/ 84 mm Hg, respiratory rate 18/ min, temperature 101°F, and pulse 74 beats per minute. On auscultation of the chest, you cannot distinguish a S1 or S2 but hear a scratching or grating sound. What is the first step in the treatment of this patient?A) PericardiocentesisB) Beta blockersC) Rest and NSAIDsD) CorticosteroidsE) No treatment necessary E) Low sodium diethe clinical picture is suggestive of . The classic syndrome consists of episodic vertigo lasting 20 minutes to several hours associated with fluctuating low-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus, and a sensation of aural pressure. The Dix-Hallpike maneuver is a diagnostic maneuver for benign paroxymal positional vertigo. Treatment involves a low sodium diet and diuretics. Restricting water intake will lead to dehydration and an increase in sodium levels, worsening the symptoms of Meniere's disease. Diazepam can be used for Meniere's disease but is usually used for severe vertigo. The question is indicating initial treatment. Diazepam is used in the treatment of vestibular neuronitis. In vestibular neuronitis, a paroxymal, usually single attack of vertigo occurs without accompanying impairment of auditory functions and will persist for several days to weeks before clearing. Examination reveals nystagmus. These symptoms are not present in this patient. Antibiotics are not indicated for Meniere's disease. Fluticasone propionate is an anti-inflammatory nasal spray used to treat the nasal symptoms of indoor and outdoor nasal allergies and year-round nonallergic nasal symptoms. Fluticasone helps reduce the inflammation that leads to nasal symptoms that include congestion, sneezing, and itchy, runny nose which are not indicated in this patient A 55-year-old woman comes to your clinic presenting with episodic vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and ear fullness. Her ear and eye physical examination are unremarkable. You perform a Dix-Hallpike maneuver which is negative. There are no carotid bruits noted on auscultation. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for this patient? A) Restrict water intakeB) Diazepam 10 mg BIDC) AntibioticsD) Fluticasone propionateE) Low sodium diet B) Atrial fibrillationThis patient has a history of hyperthyroidism, an irregularly irregular pulse, and an EKG finding of varying R-R interval and fibrillatory F waves in place of P waves, which is consistent with atrial fibrillation. Irregular rhythm, as well as lack of P waves, is particularly noted in leads II, III, and aVF. AF is typically treated with rate control in stable patients (not pharmaceutically) or cardioversion in an unstable patient. A 64-year-old woman with a past medical history of hyperthyroidism presents with new-onset palpitations. The patient states that she has intermittent palpitations, and she is worried about heart disease. She is currently asymptomatic and reports no chest pain or shortness of breath. An EKG is obtained. Vital signs reveal a T 98.6° F, BP 134/88 mm Hg, P 119 beats/min R 12/min. The pulse is noted to be irregular. The EKG is shown. What arrhythmia does the patient likely have?A) Atrial flutterB) Atrial fibrillationC) Supraventricular tachycardiaD) Ventricular tachycardiaE) Torsades de pointes E) LithotripsyThis patient has a 7mm ureteral stone and will likely require surgical intervention, such as lithotripsy, for this stone to pass. Peitrow and Micali note that 90 to 98% of stones <5 mm are likely to pass on their own, although sometimes >30 days are needed for this to occur. A variety of agents may assist in stone passage. Deflazacort, a steroid, decreases ureter edema and may facilitate stone passage through the ureter. Nifedipine and tamsulosin decrease ureter spasm, facilitating smoother stone passage through the ureter. Analgesics, particularly opioids and non-steroidals, decrease the pain associated with stones lodging in the ureter. In the case of larger stones (>5 mm), passage is unlikely. Surgical interventions for stone removal include lithotripsy, a procedure which uses sound waves to break stones into smaller pieces which can be passed. Other procedures to assist in stone management include ureteral stenting, percutaneous nephrostomy tube placement, open surgical stone removal, and retrograde ureteral stone removal. However, since open surgical removal is an invasive procedure, lithotripsy is the first choice. Lithotripsy involves the usage of shock waves to crush stones in the renal calyx. It may be done as an outpatient procedure. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy involves waves directed from outside; whereas intracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy consists of insertion of a percutaneous nephroscope and then crushing of the stones. A previously healthy 35-year-old man has had right flank pain radiating to his right groin for the past 3 hours. CT shows a 7 mm stone in his right ureter. What is the best option of treatment in this patient? A) Opioid analgesicsB) DeflazacortC) Open surgical stone removalD) TamsulosinE) Lithotripsy B) Secondary hyperparathyroidismThis patient has , based on her glomerular filtration rate of 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and her proteinuria. It is also likely that she has hyperparathyroidism. Disorders of calcium and phosphorus balance are common in kidney disease and should be evaluated starting early in the course of disease to prevent complications. Vitamin D levels, calcium and phosphorus levels, and parathyroid hormone levels (PTH) should be checked in all patients with stages 3 - 5 chronic kidney disease. Decreasing glomerular filtration rates lead to phosphorus retention. Decreased renal synthesis of hydroxylated vitamin D leads to decreased intestinal calcium reabsorption and hypocalcemia. Together, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, and hypovitaminosis D lead to hyperparathyroidism. Vitamin D usually suppresses PTH synthesis and secretion. Vitamin D deficiency removes this negative feedback, leading to hyperparathyroidism. Correction of calcium-phosphate balance is important; when it is abnormal, it can lead to vascular and valvular calcification and increased risk of cardiac death. Her phosphorus level is elevated, not low. Goal levels for patients with stages 3 and 4 kidney disease are 2.7 - 4.6 mg/dl. Her calcium level is low, not elevated. Her corrected level should be >8 mg/dl. Her PTH level is 150. Patients with stage 3 should have levels in the 35-70 pg/ml range (Brenner, ch. 52), according to National Kidney Foundation guidelines. No mention is made of Vitamin A levels in this vignette. Her vitamin D levels are low, which is consistent with impaired hydroxylation of the vitamin D compound by her kidneys. Patients with levels <30 ng/dl should be supplemented with ergocalciferol. Hypervitaminosis D (Vitamin D intoxication) occurs in the accidental or intentional intake of vitamin D or vitamin D compounds including vitamin D, vitamin D fortified milk, etc. High levels of vitamin D would be noted in this case. Additionally, since Vitamin D suppresses PTH, low levels of PTH would be noted. Vitamin D causes increased gastrointestinal calcium absorption and increased serum calcium levels. Symptoms are those of hypercalcemia (bone and abdominal pain, weakness, confusion, and possibly hematuria/flank pain/poor urine flow if renal stones develop). Treatment involves promoting kaliuresis (excreting potassium in the urine.) with volume expansion and possibly loop diuretics and steroids. A 25-year-old woman presents with fatigue. She has been diabetic for 10 years, and she takes multiple injections of insulin a day. She has no other medical problems. She takes no other medications, and she is not sexually active. Her skin shows diffuse scratch marks. Her laboratory tests show below. What is the most likely diagnosis?: A) Hypervitaminosis DB) Secondary hyperparathyroidismC) Hypervitaminosis AD) HypophosphatemiaE) Hypercalcemia B) Anemia of chronic diseaseThis patient most likely has anemia of chronic disease secondary to his chronic kidney disease. Anemia of chronic disease is characterized by normochromic normocytic anemia, decreased reticulocytes, low iron levels, normal-to-increased ferritin levels, and low soluble transferrin receptor to log ferritin ratios (Weiss). It is the second most common cause of anemia after iron deficiency anemia (Weiss), and it may complicate a variety of diseases, including infections, cancers, autoimmune diseases, chronic kidney disease, and transplant rejection. In anemia of chronic disease, high cytokine production leads to decreased gastrointestinal iron absorption, decreased regulation of iron transporters, decreased erythropoietin production, and decreased proliferation and differentiation of erythroid precursor cells. The result is normochromic normocytic anemia. Patients may complain of fatigue and decreased quality of life. Treatments include erythropoietin and iron to support hemopoiesis. Treatments may correct anemia and improve symptoms, but they will unlikely correct chronic kidney disease. A 35-year-old man with known stage 3 chronic kidney disease due to diabetes presents with fatigue. His blood sugars are acceptable; his mood is euthymic, and he is sleeping and eating well. He does not smoke, and he has no known toxic environmental exposures. Work up shows normochromic normocytic anemia, with a hemoglobin of 11 g/dl, which is decreased from 12 g/dl 6 months ago. Medications include lisinopril, furosemide, and insulin. What is the most likely diagnosis?A) Iron deficiency anemiaB) Anemia of chronic diseaseC) ThalassemiaD) MyelodysplasiaE) Pernicious anemia C) Reassure her that antidepressants are not drugs of abuse because of oral administration, lack of immediate reward, and lack of tendency to cause toleranceDrugs can be screened in animals for abuse potential. Abusable drugs are rewarding (animals will self-administer them in preference to eating/drinking) and tend to induce both tolerance and withdrawal. The more rapid the onset of the sought for changes, the more likely the drug will be abused. Rapidity of onset is related to the particular drug taken and to the mode of administration. Drugs that are injected or inhaled are especially quick in action. Inhalation, in particular, bypasses first pass metabolism in the liver. Thus, IV use of heroin or snorting of cocaine (especially highly concentrated forms known as crack) quickly leads to abuse. Conversely, patients may be reassured that most prescribed medications, even psychotropics except benzodiazepines, are not abusable drugs and patients do not become addicted to them. Giving lower doses of antidepressants or prescribing them for a few weeks would be incorrect, since the onset of action is delayed up to 3 or 4 weeks and the drugs should be continued for at least 4 months. (Short courses followed by tapering would be correct for a benzodiazepine). Antidepressants, especially cyclic antidepressants, may precipitate a withdrawal syndrome if stopped abruptly, but this alone does not make them abusable. A 35-year-old woman is reluctant to try an antidepressant for fear of becoming a drug addict. How should the physician respond?A) Respect her concerns and treat her with psychotherapy aloneB) Give her the medication and refer her to a twelve step programC) Reassure her that antidepressants are not drugs of abuse because of oral administration, lack of immediate reward, and lack of tendency to cause toleranceD) Prescribe lower than recommended doses to avoid inducing a ""high"", explain to the patient she will not become addicted as long as she stops the drug after a few weeksE) Tapering to avoid withdrawal symptoms D) Ehlers-Danlos syndromeThere are several different types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS). The clinical vignette above describes the classical, type I variant. The velvety, distensible skin, hyperextensibility of many joints, mitral valve prolapse, and hernia are all associated with the type I variant. Although the exact nature of the biochemical defect is just now being sorted out, all types of EDS are due to mutations in collagen genes. In recent experimental studies, a mutation in the gene encoding the α1(V)-chain of type-V collagen, was identified. Type- V collagen is associated with type-I collagen and is probably involved in assembly of type-I collagen fibers. Type-I collagen is abundant in ligaments of joints and in the dermis, thus the characteristic and unusual symptoms in the skin and joints A 3-year-old boy has velvety lax skin, hyperextensible joints, and mitral valve prolapse. What is the most likely diagnosis?A) Marfan syndrome B) achondroplasiaC) epidermolysis bullosaD) Ehlers-Danlos syndromeE) osteogenesis imperfecta C) ProcainamideThis question addresses issues related to the treatment of arrhythmias and lupus-like side effects. The initial treatment should control arrhythmias using lidocaine, unload the heart using a balanced vasodilator such as nitroglycerin or nitroprusside, and use aspirin and heparin to prevent further clot formation. Once discharged, patients are frequently placed on atenolol to control catecholamine-induced arrhythmias. Finally, long-term control of arrhythmias is accomplished using drugs such as procainamide or quinidine. Unfortunately, procainamide can cause lupus-like side effects. The use of thrombolytics has reduced myocardial damage caused by thrombus formation. Streptokinase, urokinase, and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) all will lyse clots. This leads to coronary reperfusion. If performed within the first several hours post-clot, myocardium will be spared. The use of aspirin and heparin are directed at prevention of platelet aggregation and clot stabilization. An 80-year-old man was treated for ventricular arrhythmias. He presents 1 month later with joint pains. He also has an unusual mask-like rash over his face and body. Discontinuation of drug therapy causes the symptoms to abate. What drug was most likely administered to this patient? A) TocainideB) QuinidineC) ProcainamideD) PhenytoinE) Propranolol D) Basal Cell CarcinomaBasal cell carcinoma usually begins as a small indented nodule localized around hair follicles, typically in sun exposed regions of the skin. It typically begins to form an ulcerated center as it enlarges. This type of tumor rarely metastasizes but is locally invasive. It can be quite disfiguring. Excision is necessary to prevent its spread. A patient comes to see you for a growth on his forearm. He has had it for 7 years and is concerned that it may be enlarging. You observe a well circumscribed, pink, slightly pigmented, raised nodule about 1 centimeter in diameter. The center appears slightly ulcerated. What is the most likely diagnosis? A) MelanomaB) Molluscum ContagiosumC) Squamous Cell CarcinomaD) Basal Cell CarcinomaE) Lipoma D) Observation only for pseudocystA pseudocyst is formed when pancreatic fluid leaks and is confined by organs adjacent to the pancreas. Eventually, a fibrous wall forms around the collection. Most cysts regress spontaneously over a period of several weeks, but in some cases complications such as bleeding, abscess formation, and intractable pain may occur. Several interventional approaches — surgical, radiologic and endoscopic — have been tried. Endoscopic ultrasound has gained popularity in the management of pseudocysts, as it can identify complex cyst wall structures, in particular pseudoaneurysms, do fine-needle aspiration to rule out a neoplasm, and find a favorable spot for drainage. Ruling out a cystic pancreas neoplasm before endoscopic drainage is essential, as attempts at transgastric emptying of a neoplasm can have disastrous effects and compromise further surgical management of the neoplasia. Indications for intervention are intractable pain, expanding lesions, and infection. A frequently quoted study found that complications such as bleeding, abscess formation, or perforation rose sharply after 6 weeks of observation, and that intervention is warranted if a pseudocyst does not resolve in this period. However, more recent studies have challenged this assumption and proposed that observing asymptomatic pseudocysts for longer periods is safe. Pseudoaneurysms are found in 10% of pseudocysts. Signs suggesting a pseudoaneurysm include overt bleeding, sudden pseudocyst enlargement, and an abrupt fall in hematocrit. Their presence is a concern when drainage is considered and does not lead to a higher overall bleeding rate or constitute indication for intervention. Angiography has higher sensitivity and can perform therapeutics, but an angio-CT scan has adequate sensitivity for ruling out a pseudoaneurysm before proceeding with therapeutics. When intervention is warranted, angiographic coil embolization and operative resection can be performed. A 48-year-old Caucasian man presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to the back after a bout of drinking. Two weeks later, a repeat ultrasound showed a round, thin-walled hypoechoic lesion near the pancreas tail measuring 4 cm in its largest diameter and with some calcifications in its walls. MRCP visualized a communication between this cavity and the pancreatic duct. Endoscopic ultrasound detected an area of high-speed flow close to the gastric wall. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?A) Perform angio-CT scanB) Perform angiography with coil embolizationC) Refer for a Puestow procedureD) Observation only B) Full colonoscopyIron-deficiency anemia in an adult should prompt for evaluation of a gastrointestinal source of bleeding. This is especially important because a malignant etiology, particularly colorectal cancer, is possible. The signs and symptoms of colon cancer vary according to the tumor's site in the colon. Distal tumors are more frequently associated with hematochezia and obstruction, while proximal neoplasia tends to produce more chronic obstruction with proximal dilatation, intermittent bleeding with iron-deficiency anemia, and a palpable mass. Recurrent infarctions lead to intermittent luminal obstruction and episodic diarrhea. Some lesions grow to a considerable size before diagnosis. In this patient, the diagnostic technique with the highest yield is full colonoscopy. It permits visualization of the whole colon; it also permits performing a biopsy for histopathologic confirmation of the diagnosis. In selected cases, colonoscopic dilatation or stent placement can alleviate obstruction before surgery is performed. Some authorities recommend routine upper endoscopy while investigating lower gastrointestinal bleeding. In some series, upper endoscopy revealed a missed bleeding source in as many as 10% of patients, and altered management in nearly 50% cases. A fecal occult blood test (FOBT) is redundant, given the presence of active bleeding and the overt signs of iron-deficiency anemia. FOBT is useful in colon cancer screening, despite its high false-positive rates (e.g., from non-cancer bleeding or foods reactive with the test reagent). Another caveat is that cancers may bleed intermittently, thereby yielding a false-negative result on a random FOBT. Barium enema is less sensitive than colonoscopy and is unable to perform biopsy. Despite these disadvantages, some authorities recommend its use for colon cancer screening. A 63-year-old Hispanic-American man presents with a 3-month history of chronic intermittent diarrhea with 5 - 6 watery stools per day; some are tinged with blood. During this period, he has had progressive fatigue and intolerance to exercise; he has lost 15 pounds (6% of body weight). Vital signs are within normal ranges. On physical examination, there is noticeable pallor. Heart sounds are regular and of normal frequency, both lung fields are clear to auscultation, the abdomen is soft and diffusely tender to palpation, particularly in the right quadrants. Rectal examination is painless, and an enlarged prostate is palpated, but there are no masses or blood. Anoscopy shows grade I hemorrhoids. There is no peripheral edema. A complete blood count shows the following: Ht 30% Hb 9.4 g/dL MCV 77 fl MCHC: 25 g/dL WBC 8.600 /mm3. w/ normal differential, platelets 460.000 /mm3; iron 56 µg/dL ferritin 5.5 µg/dL What is the most appropriate next step in management?A) Fecal occult blood testB) Full colonoscopyC) Barium enemaD) SigmoidoscopyE) Computed tomography of the abdomen D) G6PD deficiencyG6PD deficiency is a very common X-linked hemolytic disorder affecting millions across the world. The highest incidence is among people of African, Asian, or Mediterranean descent. Glucose-6-phophate dehydrogenase is an enzyme in red cells that is vital to the integrity of the cell. Deficient individuals are susceptible to hemolysis under oxidant stress caused by drugs like sulfa and antimalarials, infections, or noxious agents like fava beans. Oxidant stress causes denatured hemoglobin, resulting in Heinz bodies (small round inclusions within the red cell body). During an acute event, as in this patient, rapid hemolysis causes acute anemia, hemoglobinuria (thus the dark urine), abdominal and back pain, jaundice, and even renal failure. G6PD levels are normal to low during an acute attack, since the replacement reticulocytes are young and have adequate enzyme levels. G6PD level should be measured after an acute attack is over. Removing the precipitating agent and getting oxygen and rest is usually sufficient during an acute attack. A 29-year-old African American man develops dysuria and increased frequency of micturition. In the emergency room, he is found to have a urinary tract infection and is treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim), as well as recommended to follow up with his primary care physician in the office. Over the next few days, the patient experiences fatigue, fever, jaundice, abdominal and back pain, and dark urine. Blood tests show Hb of 4g/dl, reticulocyte count of 6%, and MCV of 93. Peripheral smear reveals cell fragments, microspherocytes, and blister or bite cells. Heinz bodies are also present. Based on these findings, which clinical entity is most likely? A) Hereditary spherocytosisB) Sickle cell anemiaC) PorphyriaD) G6PD deficiencyE) Autoimmune hemolytic anemia C) Adenocarcinoma of esophagusBarrett's esophagus is an abnormality of the distal esophagus characterized by the replacement of normal squamous epithelium by metaplastic columnar epithelium with goblet cells, as a result of continuous inflammation most commonly from acid reflux. This is a premalignant condition with potential to develop into adenocarcinoma over time. Surveillance with screening endoscopy and mucosal biopsy is indicated to detect early onset of high grade dysplasia, which is then treated with esophagectomy. Failure to be compliant with the screening regimen may lead to adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, which has a poor prognosis as it presents late. A 54-year-old male has had long term GERD symptoms. He has been on proton pump inhibitors and has had fair control of his symptoms. Other past history is unremarkable. He is a nonsmoker and drinks socially. Family history is significant for hypercholesterolemia in his father. Physical examination is unexceptional. An endoscopy a few years ago, revealed Barrett's esophagus by biopsy of the esophageal mucosa. He was recommended to have follow-up endoscopy every 2-3 years with mucosal biopsy. This screening was recommended to him because he is in danger of developingA) Achalasia of the cardiaB) Esophageal strictureC) Adenocarcinoma of esophagusD) Squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus B) Pantroprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin twice daily for 2 weeksThere are several regimens recommended for H. pylori infection, which is an important cause of peptic ulcer disease and should be treated if found associated with symptoms. The choice of the regimen depends on considerations such as cost, side effects, and ease of administration. Allergy to one of the medications, as well as intolerance, should also be taken into account. Any proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with amoxicillin 1000 mg twice daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily for 2 weeks or PPI with metronidazole 500mg twice daily and clarithromycin 500mg twice daily for 2 weeks are recommended. These are the triple drug therapies available. The other regimens suggested are bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline 4 times daily for 2 weeks along with PPI twice daily for 2 weeks or H2 receptor antagonist twice daily for 4 weeks (quadruple drug therapy). Dual therapy with a proton pump inhibitor and an antibiotic (amoxicillin or clarithromycin) is not recommended as primary therapy, since eradication rates are much lower than the above regimens. The most common side effect is a metallic taste in the mouth due to clarithromycin or metronidazole. Amoxicillin can cause diarrhea or a rash. Clarithromycin can also cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and (rarely) QT prolongation. Metronidazole can cause peripheral neuropathy, seizures, and a disulfiram-like reaction when taken with alcohol. Tetracycline is teratogenic and causes photosensitivity. A 46-year-old woman presents with a 2-month history of heartburn, epigastric discomfort, nausea, and occasional vomiting. She has a history of hyperlipidemia, controlled with diet and exercise, as well as asthma, for which she takes inhalers as needed. She takes no other medications, including over-the-counter analgesics. Family history is noncontributory. On exam she is afebrile, BP120/70 mm Hg, pulse 74/min, and SPO2 92%. Lungs are clear, and she has minimal epigastric tenderness. Otherwise, physical examination is unremarkable. She is advised by her physician to take lansoprazole once daily, which provides only partial relief. Endoscopy is then recommended, which shows a duodenal ulcer. Biopsy reveals infection with Helicobacter pylori. What would be the recommended regimen at this time?A) Lansoprazole, amoxicillin, and metronidazole twice daily for 2 weeksB) Pantroprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin twice daily for 2 weeksC) Omeprazole, tetracycline, and clarithromycin twice daily for 2 weeksD) Bismuth, metronidazole, and lansoprazole twice daily for 2 weeksE) Bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline 4 times daily for 2 weeks D) Mini-mental status examinationHint: Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales cannot be used to score adults.Hint: MRI of the brain is indicated when structural changes are suspected; however, they are not likely in this patient due to her normal neurological examination.Hint: Electroencephalography (EEG) is recording of spontaneous electrical activity of the brain; it is primarily used in the diagnosis of epilepsy, and it is sometimes used in the diagnosis of coma, encephalopathies, sleep disorders, and brain death. Your patient's sleep complaints are normal in advanced age.Hint: You should perform a thyroid function test if you find out that a patient has dementia - slowness is a part of normal aging. A 76-year-old woman presents because her children are concerned that that she might have dementia. She states that she is doing reasonably well, except that she sometimes sleeps less deeply and wakes up more often than she did several years ago. According to her children, she is slower than before, and her memory has been getting worse over the last 3 years; she has difficulties recalling the specific date of an event (although she can describe the event itself). She also has a great deal of trouble with names, but she can easily recognize people. She always says: ""It is on the tip of my tongue, but..."" Aside from hypertension that is under control, she does not have any other health problems. She has been a widow for about 10 years. Her older brother was diagnosed with dementia. Physical examination today is within normal limits for the age, and neurological examination is nonfocal. ?A) EEGB) Stanford-Binet Intelligence TestC) MRI of the brain D) Mini-mental status examinationE) TSH and T4 E) RetinoblastomaHint: Retrolental fibroplasia is an abnormal proliferation of fibrous tissue immediately behind the lens of the eye, leading to blindness. It affected many premature babies in the 1950s, owing to the excessive administration of oxygen.Hint: Phakomata are retinal findings hallmarking hamartomatous (A hamartoma is a mostly benign, focal malformation that resembles a neoplasm in the tissue of its origin) disorders such as tuberous sclerosis. The distinctive ocular lesion is a yellowish multinodular cystic lesion arising from the retina or disc. Similar lesions can occur in neurofibromatosis.Hint: Retinitis pigmentosa is a progressive degeneration of the retina. It is characterized by pigmentary changes, arteriolar attenuation, some degree of optic atrophy and progressively deteriorating visual impairment. Granularity or mottling of the retinal pigment pattern or distinctive focal pigment aggregates can be seen fundoscopically.Hint: Retinoschisis is a congenital disorder involving splitting of the retina into an inner and outer layer. Usually good vision is maintained. An elevation of the inner layer of the retina can be seen. A 2 week old female infant is seen for her newborn well baby exam after a normal birth and delivery. She has been nursing well, has regained her birthweight and her development appears normal for her age so far. Physical examination is normal with the exception that ophthalmoscopic evaluation reveals a faint white reflex in her right eye. What is the most likely diagnosis?A) Retrolental fibroplasiaB) PhakomataC) Retinitis PigmentosaD) RetinoschisisE) Retinoblastoma E) Carboxyhemoglobin levelThe family has CO poisoning. Carboxyhemoglobin is formed when inhaled CO binds to hemoglobin after being absorbed into the bloodstream. CO has an affinity for hemoglobin that is 250 times that of oxygen. Both oxygen transport and delivery to tissues are reduced as carboxyhemoglobin interferes with the dissociation of oxygen that should be provided until symptoms resolve and carboxyhemoglobin levels decrease to 5% or less. Delivery of 100% oxygen reduces the elimination half-life of CO to 1 hour from 4-5 hours.Hint: Hemoglobin level gives no indication of how much is bound to oxygen versus how much may be bound to CO. Thus, a hemoglobin level may be normal, and yet most of it may be bound to CO as carboxyhemoglobinHint: Pulse oximetry that measures oxygen saturation is falsely normal because oxyhemoglobin and carboxyhemoglobin cannot be differentiated. Pulse oximeters use 2 light emitting diodes (a red one and an infrared light). Oxygenated hemoglobin absorbs infrared light and nonoxygenated hemoglobin absorbs red light. The pulse oximeter determines the relative absorption of each and gives the percentage of oxygenated versus nonoxygenated hemoglobin present. With significant carboxyhemoglobinemia, the oximeter will reflect only the oxygen saturation of normal hemoglobin and not the percentage of hemoglobin bound to carbon monoxide.Hint: Blood gas analysis may show metabolic acidosis with a normal arterial oxygen tension (PaO2) as measurement of dissolved oxygen, and it can overestimate the true oxygen saturation of hemoglobin.Hint: Urinalysis may show myoglobinuria due to eventual muscle necrosis as CO binds to myoglobin, decreasing its oxygen-carrying capacity. A family presents in the middle of winter. They live in a low-income housing development. Their gas furnace is broken, and they have been using a kerosene heater at night. For the last 3 days, they have all been experiencing varying degrees of headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue; symptoms are particularly severe at night. A 4-year-old child has also been very lethargic; occasionally, she seems to black out or fall asleep very soundly. She and her 9-year-old sibling have also had a cough, runny nose and sore throat for the past week. On exam, other than seeming tired, findings are nonspecific. Both children have a runny nose but their lungs and ears are clear. What is the best test to confirm exposure of the most likely diagnosis in this case? A) Hemoglobin levelB) Pulse oximetryC) Blood gas analysisD) UrinalysisE) Carboxyhemoglobin level D) Repeat capillary samples, confirming with venous sample within 1 monthA blood lead level of 10-14 mcg/dL is considered moderate risk II and warrants, in addition to reporting to the local health department, repeating all capillary samples and confirming with a venous sample within 1 month for new cases and 1-3 months for known cases. As this is a new case, venous testing should be done within 1 month after repeating capillary sample. Lead based paint in older housing currently is the most important source of lead exposure. Young children's mouthing behavior and pica are widely recognized as causes of elevated blood lead concentrations. Lead is toxic to most body systems, including the nervous system, liver, and hematopoietic and renal systems. Lead irreversibly binds and impairs function of enzymes in the pathway to heme synthesis. Blood levels at which lead poisoning is defined and corresponding interventions has changed several times over the past decades. Improved understanding of subclinical toxicity on neurodevelopment has led to proactive screening and environmental intervention to prevent elevated lead levels. Treatment of lead poisoning varies with the blood lead level, though all management should focus on nutritional and environmental intervention. Chelation therapy is the mainstay of treatment for lead levels greater than 45 mcg/dL. The mother of a 3-year-old boy asks to have a blood test done on her son for lead poisoning. He has not been tested before. They have moved into an older home built before 1960. She has noticed some peeling paint on windowsills and doors and has seen small paint chips on the floors. They are now having the house repainted and are staying with relatives. A careful environmental history is obtained, risk reduction and nutrition education is provided. His fingerstick blood lead level comes back at 13mcg/dL. Which additional management should be done at this level?A) Collaborate with lead poisoning preventive program to provide home inspection and other servicesB) Repeat with a venous sample within 1-3 monthsC) Obtain abdominal radiographs and order bowel decontamination if indicatedD) Repeat capillary samples, confirming with venous sample within 1 monthE) Consider retesting within 3 months E) EpinephrineEpinephrine has significant beta-agonistic effects, which cause bronchodilation, and alpha-agonistic effects, which can reverse systemic hypotension. IM route is preferred over SC, as time for maximum serum concentration is shorter by IM route.Hint: Theophylline may be required in resistant bronchospasm.Hint: Glucagon is required only if the patient is on beta-blockers. In such patients, it exerts its effects by inotropic and chronotropic properties, which are independent of beta-receptors.Hint: Cimetidine is an H2 blocker, which may have an additive effect with H1 blockers in anaphylaxis.Hint: Methyl prednisolone, a corticosteroid, is used in all generalized reactions for its anti-inflammatory property A 23-year-old woman presents with an anaphylactic reaction after being stung by several bees. She complains of wheezing and shortness of breath. On examination, the client is in acute distress. BP is 98/56 mmHg, PR 110/min, RR 28/min, and temperature 98.7°F. She is immediately treated with supplemental oxygen. In treating this condition further, what drug is required most urgently? A) TheophyllineB) GlucagonC) CimetidineD) MethylprednisoloneE) Epinephrine C) CT scan of the sinusesThis patient is suffering from chronic sinusitis. Repeated regimens of different antibiotics have not provided him relief, and now he fits the criteria for chronic sinusitis, including 12 weeks of symptoms. Chronic sinusitis is most commonly caused by streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and moraxella catarrhalis. Together, these 3 bacteria account for 70% cases. A limited CT scan of the sinuses defines the location and extent of disease and helps in deciding further management. It is quick, low cost, and sensitive. CT scanning also helps in delineating anastomotic blockage of the osteomeatal complex; therefore, there is a role for it in cases of endoscopic surgery.Hint: Plain X-rays are no longer recommended; they are not sensitive enough in the visualization of the sinuses, and they often miss findingsHint: MRI of the sinuses tells us more about the soft tissue pathology, but bony structures cannot be studied in detail. MRI is done if malignancy is suspected or there are signs and symptoms of possible intracranial extension.Hint: Nasal cultures can be contaminated with colonized organisms in the nose, such as staphylococcus aureus, and do not correlate well with culture obtained from the sinuses. Endoscopically-guided cultures of secretions in the middle meatus or within a sinus are usually not done in clinical practice, even though occasionally it may provide the exact causative pathogen.Hint: A 3-week course of antibiotics may relieve symptoms briefly, but it is unlikely to cure him, especially since he already has had several courses. Amoxicillin-clavulanate or cefuroxime are traditionally used for 3 weeks. In intractable cases, a 6-week course may also be given. Clarithromycin and clindamycin are used for patients who are allergic to penicillin. Quinolones are only used if cultures show Gram-negative bacteria. A 36-year-old man presents with nasal stuffiness, headache, fatigue, facial pain, and chronic post-nasal drip. He has had similar episodes in the past; on average, they have occured 2 - 3 times a year for the last several years. He has been diagnosed with acute sinusitis, and antibiotics have been prescribed; they have provided him with relief for a brief period. This time, however, his symptoms have bothered him on and off for the last 3 months; he was given a 14-day course of antibiotics, but he experienced only partial relief. He is tired of the recurrent episodes, and he wants a cure. On exam, he is afebrile; nasal mucosa is inflamed, and there is mucopurulent secretion in the nasal cavity. The right maxillary sinus is tender on palpation. Lungs are clear. What is the best next step in the management of this patient?A) A 3-week course of antibioticsB) Plain X-ray views of the sinusesC) CT scan of the sinusesD) Nasal and sinus culturesE) MRI of the sinuses B) AngiographyIn patients with acute or chronic intestinal ischemia, a CTA or MRA can demonstrate narrowing of the proximal visceral vessels. In acute intestinal ischemia from a nonocclusive low flow state, angiography is needed to display the typical ""pruned tree"" appearance of the distal visceral vascular bed.

Pregnancy Week-by-Week - First, Second, Third Trimester) Medical Editor: What Should You Know about Your Baby's Growth Week-by-Week? When Should You Call a Doctor or Midwife During Pregnancy? What Questions Should You Ask Your Doctor about Pregnancy? What Monitoring May be Necessary during Your Pregnancy? What Factors Determine the Outcome of You and Your Baby's Health? What Medications Are Safe to Take if You Are Pregnant? What Should You Know about Your Baby's Growth Week-by-Week? Pregnancy occurs when an egg is fertilized by a sperm, grows inside a woman's uterus (womb), and develops into a baby. In humans, this process takes about 264 days from the date of of the egg, but the obstetrician will date the pregnancy from the first day of the last (280 days 40 weeks). After the initial visit and during the first six months of pregnancy, you should see your doctor approximately once per month. Visits should be scheduled every two weeks during the seventh and eighth month and weekly during the ninth month. Electronic fetal monitoring, sequential examinations, or admission to the hospital may also be required depending on your circumstances. Pregnancy occurs with the fertilization of a woman's egg by a man's sperm. drugs may improve a woman's odds of achieving a pregnancy. The doctor will probably provide the woman who is pregnant with information to read regarding her pregnancy. She should ask questions if she needs help understanding the written information or what is happening during the pregnancy. Your doctor or midwife will use certain terms when he/she talks to you about your pregnancy. A normal pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus (womb) and an embryo grows. The term used for the developing fertilized egg during the first 9 weeks of pregnancy. The term used for the developing embryo after 9 weeks of gestation. Beta (also called beta-hCG): This hormone is secreted by the placenta and can be measured to determine the presence and progression of the pregnancy. Urine or blood can be tested for its presence, and it is the hormone involved in the performance of a . A positive result means a woman is pregnant; however, this test result can stay positive for several weeks after delivering a baby or following a spontaneous . The duration of an individual pregnancy is divided into three periods called (approximately three months in duration). Each trimester is characterized by specific events and developmental markers. For instance, the includes the differentiation of the different organ systems. The delivery date is estimated by counting forward 280 days from the first day of the woman's last period. It is also called the estimated date of confinement (EDC). Symptoms of pregnancy include tenderness pr discharge, , , or both, missing a period or having an abnormal period, weight gain, breast enlargement, nipples darkening, or breast discharge, and urinating more often than usual. Fetal movement (may be perceived after 20 weeks for new mothers) When Should You Call a Doctor or Midwife During Pregnancy? If a woman suspects that she may be pregnant or if she has a positive home , she should make an appointment with a health-care professional, which could be a doctor, an obstetrician (women's health specialist), a family physician, a midwife, or a nurse practitioner. Early is essential to insure a favorable pregnancy outcome. A woman who is pregnant should call her healthcare professional if any of the following conditions develop: Vomiting more frequently than three times per day or vomiting blood Go to your nearest Emergency Department if you have any of these symptoms: Vaginal through more than one pad per hour Having severe pain in the abdomen or shoulder or severe Passing pink, gray, or white material from the vagina that does not look like a (The woman who is pregnant should take the material to the hospital.) Having a bloody discharge or gush of fluid from the vagina during late pregnancy (this may indicate that the onset of labor is imminent). activity but without a history of (This may indicate , a complication of pregnancy). Having an injury, such as a fall, a blow to the stomach or pelvis, or a car accident Lower during late in pregnancy may indicate the onset of labor. Labor pains occur secondary to uterine contractions. A patient may attempt consumption of clear liquids or lying on her left side for a short time to determine if the contractions will resolve spontaneously. If the pain persists, her health care provider should be notified. What Questions Should You Ask Your Doctor about Pregnancy? Your OB/GYN or Midwife should ask you these questions when you get pregnant. How should I alter my (especially if she is a or a vegan)? What tests should I have and when should I schedule them? What vaccinations should I receive during pregnancy? Will I be allowed to have keepsake ultrasound pictures? Several tests may be conducted while a woman is pregnant. Women may choose to perform a . This is a urine test kit that can be purchased at a pharmacy or grocery store without a prescription. The test can indicate whether a woman is pregnant. This type of test is known as a qualitative test. It can only test for the presence of the pregnancy hormone, beta-hCG. If a doctor is considering prescribing a medication that might not be appropriate for consumption during pregnancy, one of these simple tests may be performed in the office to determine if a woman is pregnant or to make sure she is not pregnant. If the test is performed very early in a pregnancy, the hormone level may still be negative. Most current home pregnancy tests can show positive results immediately after the first missed menstrual period. If your OB/GYN or Midwife may order sophisticated tests are called quantitative hCG levels. These testes determine the hCG levels in the bloodstream. This type of test is done by drawing blood for testing. These levels indicate approximately how far along a woman is in her pregnancy. If levels of hCG do not rise as she progresses through her pregnancy, it could indicate a problem pregnancy such as an with low levels or twins with high levels. A doctor may use sound waves to examine the pelvic structures such as the uterus, ovaries, and the embryo or fetus. A conductive gel is placed on the abdomen, and a hand-held wand which emits sound waves is moved in a systematic pattern in an effort to examine the internal structures. This test requires a full bladder so that the organs in question are lifted out of the pelvis as the bladder fills. The patient may be asked to drink two to three glasses of water starting an hour prior to the test. This method works best for more advanced pregnancies when the fetus is well developed. The physician may have a vaginal scan performed during the first trimester to make sure the pregnancy is within the uterus and to rule out an ectopic pregnancy. It is also possible to visualize the fetal heartbeat and movement, and, thus, rule out a miscarriage. The vaginal scan can also determine if there is more than one pregnancy within the uterus. During the remainder of the pregnancy, scans may be used to look for problems, assess the age and development of the fetus, check out its position within the uterus, and, between 16 and 20 weeks, determine the fetal sex. There is no risk to the woman or her developing fetus with ultrasound, and it is not uncomfortable. Ultrasound examinations aid doctors in establishing an accurate due date. The estimated date of delivery can now be predicted within two to four days if the initial ultrasound is performed early in pregnancy. A long, thin, sound-wave wand is covered with a filled with conductive gel is placed inside the vagina. This type of ultrasound is usually performed early in pregnancy to confirm the intrauterine location of the fetus. This type of ultrasound also gives more detail regarding the structure of the woman's cervix and early embryonic anatomy. A targeted or level II ultrasound exam provides a detailed assessment of fetal anatomy. It is recommended if there are concerns for fetal problems based on other tests or history. It is usually performed by a Maternal-Fetal Medicine specialist (perinatologist). A non-invasive screening for genetic defects. A certified ultrasound technologist measures the fold at the back of the neck. Measurements are then used to calculate the risk factor for certain birth defects. It is usually done at 10 to 14 weeks gestation and offered with a blood test that also screens for birth defects. Sickle cell screening if of African American heritage tests, , and tests for Alpha fetoprotein tests or Quad Screen Test: A Quad Screen looks for four specific substances, Alpha fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, Estriol (an estrogen), and Inhibin-A (a protein produced by the placenta and ovaries). Group B streptococcal test between 35 and 37 weeks of pregnancy Test for (BV), candida, and trichomonas - these are performed as needed if the woman has , burning with urination, or itching around the outside of the vagina. throughout the pregnancy. Eat a common-sense balanced diet. Expect to gain between 25 to 35 pounds if you are of normal weight. Expect to gain less wait if you are (approximately 10 to 15 pounds). or initiate non- without consulting a physician, but also consult with a doctor before taking any nonprescription medications.

Continue to with normal routines unless the doctor advises otherwise. Stay hydrated during sessions. It is OK to have while you are pregnant if you don't have any complications. If you aren't sure, ask your OB/GYN or Midwife. What Monitoring May be Necessary during Your Pregnancy? Sometimes late in pregnancy, a woman who is pregnant may be placed on a fetal monitor to verify the health of the fetus or to see if the woman is in early labor. This is a noninvasive test uses ultrasound to assess whether or not the baby is receiving an adequate supply of oxygen. It is typically performed during high risk pregnancies or if a woman has gone past her due date. What Medications Are Safe to Take if You Are Pregnant? Because some medicines are not safe to take during pregnancy, it is important that a woman take only those that have been approved by her doctor. If anyone tries to prescribe a new medicine, the woman should explain that she is pregnant and ask if the drug is safe. The US Food and Drug Administration previously listed five categories of pharmaceutical labeling for drugs which might be used during pregnancy. A doctor or pharmacist can provide advice on the safety level (indicated by category) of medications before a pregnant patient begins their usage. Doctors will often use category B and C medications (see the following list) if it is felt that the potential benefit of the product outweighs any risks. Few conditions during pregnancy can be treated adequately with category A medications. The FDA categories were instituted in 2015.  - Safety established using human studies - Presumed safety based upon animal studies - Uncertain safety with animal studies showing an adverse effect - Unsafe with evidence of risk that may, in certain clinical circumstances, be justifiable - Highly unsafe with risk or use outweighing any possible benefit A pregnant woman and her doctor will monitor the pregnancy to exclude or prevent certain pregnancy conditions. The physician will also treat non pregnancy-related medical conditions in such a way as to promote the appropriate physical and neurological development of the fetus. Conditions of particular importance include: If you are considered prone to certain complications during pregnancy, she will be classified as high risk. Examples include pregnancies in women with and/or . Age-related complications can occur in women such as teenagers, women who are over the age of 35, or those who have been treated for and have pregnancies resulting from the use of assisted reproductive technology. This is a pregnancy in which the egg implants somewhere other than the uterus. This complication can be life-threatening. Ectopic pregnancy must be diagnosed early to avoid damage to the Fallopian tubes and to prevent serious maternal illness or death. It is also called (if the egg implants in the Fallopian tubes) or extra-uterine pregnancy. This is a condition in which the cervix begins to open (widen) and/or efface (thin) without contractions before the pregnancy has reached term. Cervical incompetence can be a cause of mid-pregnancy miscarriage. In this condition, the uterus begins to contract before the baby has reached full-term. Preeclampsia is a systemic disease that can affect various organ systems. Vascular effects cause the blood pressure to rise in a pregnant woman. The condition may cause kidney damaged, generalized swelling, hyperactive reflexes, as well as deleterious abnormalities in blood chemistry and nerve reflexes. If left untreated, preeclampsia can proceed to eclampsia, a serious condition which may result in , , and even death.Multiple Gestation (for example, twins and triplets).  Preterm births are twice as likely in twin pregnancies as single pregnancies. The percentage of preterm birth is even greater for triplet pregnancies and higher order pregnancies. Preeclampsia is also seen three to five times more frequently with multiple gestation. refers to methods used to prevent pregnancy. There are many ways to prevent pregnancy, but none of them is 100% effective with the exception of abstinence. Methods of contraception can vary widely in their effectiveness. Permanent : male () or female (, tubal implant, Essure sterilization) Hormonal contraceptives: pills , patches, birth control vaginal ring Intra-uterine device () or intra-uterine system () : withdrawal by the male before Rhythm method: Not having sex during the time when is woman is most likely to be What Factors Determine the Outcome of You and Your Baby's Health? The amount of weight a woman gains when pregnant can be important in predicting the outcome of pregnancy. Excess weight gain places a woman who is pregnat  at risk for and , and it may increase the chance for needing a cesarean birth (). Too little weight gain places the infant at risk for interuterine growth restriction and the mother at risk for , nutritional deficiencies, and . : Even if a pregnant patient experiences what seems like an abnormal amount of nausea and vomiting (), it probably will not affect the baby's health, particularly if the woman is still gaining weight at the anticipated rate. The normal range varies slightly between laboratories, but is generally 4.2 - 5.9 million red cells per microliter. The risk of delivering prematurely is increased if the woman's blood count is low (anemia). Low blood counts also put her at risk of requiring a transfusion following a delivery. If the woman's blood count is too high (), her baby may be larger than expected. A person with a body mass index (BMI) over 30 is considered obese. If a woman who is pregnant is obese and has , her baby is three times more likely to have a birth defect. If she is obese but does not have diabetes, the risk of birth defects is not increased. If the pregnant patient is older than 35 years, her infant is at a higher risk of birth defects and complications. The focus of genetic screening is to enable the woman to understand any problems her may have. There is a 2% to 3% rate of major birth defects in this population. A pregnancy which is deficient in the nutrient folic acid, also known as folate, can lead to neural tube defects such as in the fetus. Neural tube defects are malformations of the brain and which typically occur within the first few weeks of pregnancy; therefore, folic acid supplementation should be taken prior to and throughout the course of the pregnancy. It is recommended all non-pregnant women take a daily supplement containing 400mg of folate and pregnant women should take a supplement with 1000mg of folate. During pregnancy, a diet which is deficient in the omega-3 docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can lead to inadequate development of the eyes, brain, and of a fetus. It is recommended that pregnant and lactating women consume 300mg DHA per day. DHA is found in animal meats, fish, eggs, and vegetable oils. Having an Omega-3 deficiency during pregnancy can be harmful to both the mother and the baby. Omega-3's are polyunsaturated that support the growth and development of a fetus and help reduce the risks of pregnancy complications. It is recommended women consume 300mg of Omega-3's daily during the course of pregnancy. This nutrient can be found in water fish, eggs, walnuts, and dark green leafy vegetables. For most home pregnancy tests, you either hold a test strip in your urine stream as you urinate into the toilet or you collect your urine in a clean cup and dip your test strip into the cup. The test usually takes only a few minutes. Some tests are able to detect low levels of hCG, indicating pregnancy. For the most reliable results, test 1-2 weeks after you have missed your period. You can improve your chances for an accurate result by using your first morning urine for the test. If you think you are pregnant, but your first test was negative, you can take the test again after several days. The home pregnancy test and the urine pregnancy test used by your health-care professional are similar. Both can detect hCG, but your provider is probably more experienced in running the test.

Are there Support Groups and Counseling for Spina Bifida? Spina bifida (“cleft spine”) is a birth defect affecting the spinal column. Spina bifida progresses from a cleft, or splitlike opening, in the back part of the backbones (the spinal vertebrae). In more severe cases, it involves the . Spina bifida is the most common of a group of birth defects known as neural tube defects, which affect the (brain and spinal cord). Spina bifida begins in the womb, when the tissues that fold to form the neural tube do not close or do not stay closed completely. This causes an opening in the vertebrae, which surround and protect the spinal cord. This occurs just a few weeks (21 to 28 days) after —usually before the woman knows that she is . There are 3 types of spina bifida. Spina bifida occulta: “Occulta” means hidden, and the defect is not visible. Spina bifida occulta is rarely linked with complications or symptoms. Spina bifida occulta is usually discovered accidentally when the person has an x-ray or for some other reason. The prevalence of occulta is not known, but it is probably the most common type of spina bifida. Meningocele: The membrane that surrounds the spinal cord may enlarge, creating a lump or “This is often invisible through the skin and causes no problems. If the spinal canal is cleft, or “bifid,” the may expand and come to the surface. In such cases, since the cyst does not enclose the spinal cord, the cord is not exposed. The cyst varies in size, but it can almost always be removed surgically if necessary, leaving no permanent disability. This is an uncommon type of spina bifida. Spina bifida cystica (myelomeningocele): This is the most complex and severe form of spina bifida. Spina bifida cystica usually involves neurological problems that can be very serious or even fatal. A section of the spinal cord and the nerves that stem from the cord are exposed and visible on the outside of the body. Or, if there is a cyst, it encloses part of the cord and the nerves. This condition, which was documented 4000 years ago, accounts for most cases of true spina bifida. The term “spina bifida” often is used interchangeably with myelomeningocele, since this is the type of spina bifida that causes the vast majority of disability. Fortunately, surgery is an effective treatment in most people with spina bifida. Most infants with an open spine or myelomeningocele undergo surgery within the first 48 hours of life to close the defect. are given to prevent infection of the exposed spinal cord and nerves until these structures can be protected by surgery. Before antibiotics were available, most children born with myelomeningocele died soon after birth. Those who survived were severely disabled. With modern treatment, almost all children with myelomeningocele survive and most are able to live productive lives with some degree of independence. Even with these treatments, however, most have some degree of permanent leg paralysis and often difficulties with bowel and bladder function. The extent of paralysis depends on which part of the spinal cord is involved. The higher the defect on the body, the more severe the paralysis. Most myelomeningoceles occur in the lumbar (lower back) and sacral (tailbone) regions of the spine. Spina bifida is one of the most common severe birth defects, historically occurring in 1 live birth per 1000 in the United States. The rates of spina bifida are higher in Hispanics and whites of European descent than in Ashkenazi Jews, Asians, and African Americans. Rates are also higher among mothers with certain health problems, such as or (taking certain anticonvulsants), and significantly higher among couples in which at least one has spina bifida, and among couples who have already had a child with spina bifida. The outlook for spina bifida has improved remarkably in the last decade. Not only have advanced surgical techniques improved quality of life for people born with spina bifida, but evolving approaches to early diagnosis have even opened the possibility of corrective surgery while still in the womb. Furthermore, studies completed in the 1990s showed that as many as 70% of cases of neural tube defects could be prevented by adequate intake of immediately before and in early . A rigorous program of public education and fortification of popular foods with folic acid in the United States has decreased the rate of neural tube defects in just a few years. Both genetic factors (heredity) and environmental factors, such as and exposure to harmful substances, probably contribute to spina bifida. Spina bifida does seem to run in families, although with mixed patterns of inheritance. Having a child with spina bifida increases the chance that another child will also have spina bifida by 8 times. In about 95% of cases of spina bifida, however, there is no family history of neural tube defects.Research has suggested that many cases of spina bifida can be prevented by adequate intake of folic acid (folate) before and during early pregnancy. However, people with spina bifida appear to have abnormal metabolism of folic acid. This suggests that the underlying problem in spina bifida may be an inborn defect in folic acid metabolism rather than a simple deficiency in this nutrient. Meningocele and myelomeningocele are evident at birth. Other than the obvious spinal cord deformity, symptoms are caused by complications of spina bifida. The most common complications include the following: People with spina bifida occulta are almost always completely asymptomatic. Even after one or more operations to correct the defects, some disability almost always remains. Various degrees of leg paralysis, spine curvature (), hip, foot, and leg deformities, and problems with bowel and bladder control are the most common residual disabilities. Abnormalities at the lower spine are always accompanied by upper spine abnormalities (Arnold-Chiari malformation), causing subtle coordination problems that usually can be improved by physical therapy. Spine, hip, foot, and leg deformities are often due to imbalances in muscle strength and function resulting mostly from residual paralysis, but with a spasticity component. The most common bladder and bowel problems are inability to voluntarily relax the muscles (sphincters) that hold urine in the bladder and stool in the rectum. Hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid in the brain) is another common residual problem, affecting most people with spina bifida. Having some fluid around the brain is normal and healthy, but in spina bifida the fluid often cannot drain naturally. Without treatment, this extra fluid can cause neurological problems or mental retardation; however, these individuals are of normal intelligence if their hydrocephalus is treated aggressively. Hydrocephalus often recurs gradually after treatment. Many children with myelomeningocele have or develop a tethered spinal cord. The cord is attached to surrounding tissues and cannot move up and down freely as it normally does. This can cause foot or leg deformities, , or scoliosis. The problems can worsen as the child grows and the tethered cord is stretched. (due to inactivity) and urinary tract disorders (due to poor drainage) are common complications of spina bifida. Pathologic bone fractures occur in a significant percentage of people with spina bifida. A pathologic is a break that occurs because of weakness or disease in the bones, not solely because of injury. A very minor injury can worsen a pathologic fracture, causing pain and bringing the fracture to medical attention. resulting in is common in people with spina bifida. On average they are several inches shorter than siblings or peers. Although most people with spina bifida have normal intelligence, many have learning disorders. Adequate treatment of hydrocephalus and adaptive physical therapy are necessary to permit access to educational opportunities. Psychological, social, and sexual problems occur more often in people with spina bifida than in the general population. to latex (a natural rubber used in medical gloves, some types of elastic, balloons, and many other common items) is very common in people with spina bifida. This is thought to be a result of intense exposure to latex in the early years of life because of frequent surgeries and other medical procedures. An to latex can be life threatening. Even individuals with no apparent symptoms or disability from spina bifida may have subtle or mild signs or neurological problems. Some, for example, have a dimple, darkening, or small hairy patch on the skin overlying the base of the spine. Others have a fatty growth called an epidural that forms within the spinal canal; this is usually harmless but may result in tethering of the spinal cord. For some children, evaluation for spina bifida begins before they are born. A test measures the level of maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP, or AFP), which is unusually high in women carrying a fetus with spina bifida or other neural tube defect. This test usually is done as one of 3 tests known together as the “triple screen.” The triple screen includes AFP, , and testing of amniotic fluid. Any pregnant woman who has a high level of AFP should undergo 2 additional tests that are very accurate in detecting severe spina bifida: ultrasound of the fetal spine and testing of the amniotic fluid for AFP. Amniotic fluid is the fluid that surrounds the fetus in the womb. A small amount of the fluid is removed through a large needle and tested in various ways that might indicate abnormalities in the fetus. Removal of amniotic fluid is a safe, routine procedure called amniocentesis. The evaluation of a child with spina bifida includes the following: Thorough analysis of individual medical history (if not ), family medical history, and details of the pregnancy and birth. Physical examination focusing on neurological deficits, musculoskeletal deformities, and psychological evaluation; in an older child, assessment of developmental, social, and learning disorders. Evaluation of critical body systems such as heart, blood circulation, , and kidneys to ensure child’s ability to undergo surgery. Imaging studies are done as needed to detect new or worsening complications. X-rays are used to detect vertebral abnormalities, scoliosis, hip deformities, pathologic fractures, and other bony abnormalities that are common and may or may not cause pain and other symptoms in spina bifida. Ultrasound may be used to assess an area of pain that suggests pathologic fracture. of the head is used to evaluate for hydrocephalus. MRI provides the best detailed information on spinal cord abnormalities and the extent of cord and nerve root involvement. Gait analysis is an assessment of the child’s skills. Walking involves many different body systems, including the brain, the sensory organs (such as the eyes), the spinal cord and , the bones and joints of the neck, back, hips, legs, and , and the muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Gait is a complex activity. It can be impaired by any defect in any of these systems. Gait analysis looks at all these systems and their interactions to identify patterns and problems in balance, movement, strength, and coordination. The findings of gait analysis can be used to help people with spina bifida improve their ability to walk. Treatment for spina bifida depends on the severity of the condition. Most people with spina bifida occulta require no treatment at all. Children with meningocele typically require surgical removal of the cyst and survive with little, if any, disability. Children with myelomeningocele, however, require complex and often lifelong treatment and assistance. Almost all of them survive with appropriate treatment starting soon after birth. Their quality of life depends at least partially on the speed, efficiency, and comprehensiveness with which that treatment is provided. A child born with myelomeningocele requires specialty care. The child should be transferred immediately to a center where newborn surgery can be performed. Treatment with antibiotics is started as soon as the myelomeningocele is recognized; this prevents infection of the spinal cord, which can be fatal. The operation involves closing the opening in the spinal cord and covering the cord with muscles and skin taken from either side of the back. The most common complications are tethered spinal cord and hydrocephalus, which can have very severe consequences. Each person with severe spina bifida requires intensive and complex care by a trained and coordinated team. The care team includes one or more pediatricians, neurologists, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, physical medicine specialists, endocrinologists, urologists, physical therapists, orthotics specialists, occupational therapists, psychologists, nurses, dietitians, social workers, and other professionals. If at all possible, the individual with spina bifida should receive care at a specialized multidisciplinary spina bifida clinic where all necessary services, which are extensive, can be provided in a coordinated and convenient manner. A list of these clinics throughout the United States is available from the . There is no cure for spina bifida. The goal of treatment for spina bifida is to allow the individual to achieve the highest possible level of function and independence. Treatment should address any disability, physical, emotional, or educational, that interferes with that person’s potential After newborn surgery, children with severe spina bifida undergo regular assessment to detect any deformities, developmental problems, or other complications that may require intervention. Children should be watched for signs of hydrocephalus, tethered spinal cord, activity, obesity, bowel and/or , frequent , learning disorders, emotional and psychosocial problems, and other complications of spina bifida. Care at a multidisciplinary spina bifida facility will allow the earliest possible detection of these complications, when treatment is most likely to be effective and prevent further deterioration. The focus of treatment is developing strength, mobility, and independence. Many of these children will walk. For others, accessibility is the goal. Parents should work with a physical therapist to learn how to the baby’s legs to maximize strength and movement. They should begin these exercises as soon after the first surgery as possible. This not only readies the child for walking, but also prevents due to disuse. Children with spina bifida should be provided with prolonged physical therapy, physical education, or adaptive training while in school. Many children can become mobile by wearing a brace or using or an orthotic. These devices allow the child to function at the best possible level by helping with balance, , and control. Additional operations may be necessary to correct problems interfering with walking and other functions. Despite this assistance, some children with spina bifida will never be able to walk independently. These children will use a wheelchair for the rest of their lives. Bowel and bladder disorders can cause not only physical problems, but also social problems due to teasing, rejection, and isolation. Children can be taught techniques for emptying their bladder and bowels appropriately and independently, thus avoiding embarrassment. For example, use of a plastic tube (catheter) to drain urine from the bladder on a regular schedule can help prevent overfilling, which can injure the kidneys. This technique, called clean intermittent catheterization, is of proven benefit in people with spina bifida. Prevention and treatment of obesity is an important aspect of medical care for the person with spina bifida. Education and counseling concerning physical activity and dietary choices can help maintain weight at a healthy level. Treatment for other complications of spina bifida depends on the nature of the complications. Medications, surgery, physical therapy, or behavioral therapy may be appropriate. Surgery is the most common treatment for spina bifida and its complications. Most children with severe spina bifida require a series of operations. The first, which usually is done in the first 48 hours of the child’s life, involves tucking the exposed spinal cord and nerve roots back into the surrounding membrane, closing the defects in cord and membrane, and covering the with muscle and skin flaps taken from either side of the back. Subsequent surgeries involve correction of deformities. This might include cutting tendons or ligaments to release contractures and/or rebalancing muscles around the involved joint. When regular examinations indicate that the individual’s functioning is declining while a physical deformity gets worse, surgery should be considered. Urologic surgery is often necessary, because unresisted contracture limits the ability of the bladder to hold enough urine to space out emptying and may obstruct flow from the kidneys. Untreated, this can lead to , which can cause premature death. In the 1990s, pioneering surgeons developed a technique for repairing the spinal cord while the fetus is still in the womb. The reasoning behind this is that the longer the spinal cord is exposed to outside elements, even in the womb, the greater the possibility for damage to the cord and nerve roots. Thus, earlier surgery could prevent some of the damage that has already occurred by the time the baby is born. Preliminary results have been good in that who underwent prenatal surgery are less likely than babies who underwent surgery at birth to require a shunt for drainage of hydrocephalus fluid. This surgery is not without risk, of course; like any operation, it carries significant risks. This surgery also sharply increases the risk of premature birth, which entails its own set of risks for the baby. It is too early to tell yet whether this operation is worth the risks it entails. Researchers are observing the children who have undergone this surgery as they grow, to see whether they do better than children who undergo the conventional surgery. Hydrocephalus usually is treated by placement of a shunt. A shunt is a special tube surgically placed in the head and under the skin down into the chest or abdomen. The shunt drains excess fluid from the brain into the abdomen, where it can be eliminated without harm. A child’s emotional and social development can be deeply affected by physical disabilities such as spina bifida. To keep this development on as “normal” a track as possible, these children should be part of the mainstream whenever possible. Most of these children can be educated in mainstream schools. They should be evaluated for learning disorders, which can (and must, by federal law) be addressed by the public school system. Children should be in the least restrictive environment possible. They should learn skills that help them be as independent as possible. They should be encouraged to participate with their peers in age-appropriate activities such as clubs and teams to the best of their abilities. Children should take on responsibility for their own care as much as possible. After childhood, group homes may be used to train patients with spina bifida to live independently. People with spina bifida should be seen frequently by the appropriate professionals so that they can be checked for progressing deformities, disabilities, or complications that may require intervention. A specialized “clinic” can assemble the needed professionals, so parents are not spending all of their time taking the child for medical attention. The effectiveness of their physical therapy, including their , orthotics, crutches, and wheelchair, should be checked often and changes made if necessary. Development of hydrocephalus or worsening of deformities warrants the attention of the appropriate surgeon. Medical complications such as obesity or require appropriate treatment. The goal is to prevent secondary chronic complications such as , , and kidney problems. The individual’s educational progress should be checked; learning disorders should be addressed with appropriate training. Their emotional and social development also needs to be checked and appropriate treatment or counseling offered if needed. The only known way to prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects is for the mother to have adequate folic acid levels before and during early pregnancy. This does not work in all cases, but studies have shown cases of severe spina bifida could be prevented by adequate folic acid intake. The need for folic acid increases during periods of rapid growth, such as development of a fetus in the womb. Many breakfast cereals and grain products in the United States are now fortified with folic acid. Besides fortified foods, other good sources of folic acid include dark green leafy vegetables (for example, broccoli, spinach, dark green lettuce), egg yolks, beans, whole grains, orange juice, and citrus fruits. The average in the United States does not include the recommended level of folic acid. It is very important that folic acid levels be adequate from the very beginning of pregnancy, before a woman even knows that she is pregnant. The critical need for folic acid is in the first 4 weeks of pregnancy. Waiting until she knows she is pregnant to start increasing folic acid intake is not good enough. All women who are able to become pregnant should take a folic acid supplement, even if they are not planning to become pregnant. (Half of all pregnancies in the United States are not planned.) The folic acid may be taken alone or as part of a daily . Women who do not plan to become pregnant in the near future should take 400 micrograms (mcg) per day. This strength of folic acid is available over the counter without a prescription. Women who plan to become pregnant in the near future and have spina bifida themselves, have had a child with spina bifida, or have had a previous pregnancy affected by spina bifida or another neural tube defect should take 10 times this dose (4000 mcg, or 4 milligrams [mg]) for 1-3 months before . This higher dose is available only by prescription. Women should not try to get 4000 mcg of folic acid by taking 10 multivitamins every day. The extra amounts of other could harm the woman and her fetus. Studies have suggested that cesarean delivery before labor begins can reduce the severity of paralysis in many babies with spina bifida. Couples who have a prenatal diagnosis of spina bifida for their baby may wish to consider a planned cesarean delivery. The outlook for any individual with spina bifida depends on the number and severity of complications. For more information about complications, see Spina Bifida Symptoms. With appropriate, coordinated multidisciplinary care, most children with spina bifida survive well into adulthood. Most live within the mainstream of society and are capable of living productive and happy lives. Are there Support Groups and Counseling for Spina Bifida? Clearly, children with spina bifida have very substantial problems. They will always be different from healthy children. Most children with spina bifida have the potential to learn, achieve, succeed, and create a happy life for themselves, but not without effort. They need the help of their families. Having a child with spina bifida brings many challenges. It is understandable, then, that parents and siblings of a child with spina bifida have significant . You may feel guilt, anger, , and/or hopelessness. You may feel alone and uncertain about what you should do. Parents and siblings can help, but you need to have appropriate expectations and get organized. Only then can you learn practical ways to cope with the child’s problems and put these methods into practice. But making changes is not always easy. Sometimes it helps to have someone to talk to. This is the purpose of support groups. Support groups consist of people in the same situation as you. They come together to help each other and to help themselves. Support groups provide reassurance, motivation, and inspiration. They help you see that your situation is not unique and not hopeless, and that gives you power. They also provide practical tips on coping with spina bifida and navigating the medical, educational, and social systems that you will rely on for help for yourself or your child. Being in a spina bifida support group is strongly recommended by most mental health professionals. Support groups meet in person, on the telephone, or on the Internet. To find a support group that works for you, contact the following organization. You can also ask a member of your child’s care team, or go on the internet. If you do not have access to the internet, go to the public library. - (800) 621-3141 or (202) 944-3285 Medically reviewed by Aimee V.

Symptoms, Treatment, Pictures Uterine fibroids are noncancerous tumors that grow along or within the walls of the uterus. They are primarily made up of smooth muscle cells, along with small amounts of other tissues. They range dramatically in size. Some fibroids are microscopic, whereas others may be eight or more inches across. On average, these tumors range from about the size of a large marble to a bit smaller than a baseball. Sometimes fibroids are found alone, and other times they grow in clusters. Many of them grow, but others shrink or remain the same size as time passes. To understand this most common noncancerous tumor in women of childbearing age, read along as we provide medically-reviewed information about symptoms, treatments, and pictures. Along the way you will learn sometimes surprising facts about these growths, arming yourself with useful information. Fibroid tumors are benign by definition. When a smooth muscle tumor is cancerous, it is called leiomyosarcoma and occurs only once in every 1,000 smooth muscle tumors of the uterus. This type of cancer is not believed to arise from benign fibroids. Your chances of developing a cancerous growth do not increase because you have uterine fibroids, nor does having them increase your chances of getting other uterine cancers. Most women with fibroids (also known as leiomyomas) experience no symptoms. But for at least 25% of patients, some symptoms will occur. These may involve abdominal pressure, which can feel like fullness in the pelvic region or bloating in the pelvis or stomach. Large leiomyomas can enlarge the lower stomach area, sometimes giving the false appearance of pregnancy. Uterine fibroids can also impact your monthly menstrual cycle. This can take various forms. Some experience mild to severe cramping and pain. Others will find their bleeding is heavier, and their heavy periods sometimes include blood clots. Others find their menstruation lasts longer or becomes more frequent. It can also cause spotting or bleeding in between menstruation. Other potential symptoms of uterine fibroids include pain during sexual intercourse and lower back pain. Because the leiomyomas can press against the bladder, they may provoke frequent urination. Both uterine fibroids and endometriosis cause pelvic pain, and sometimes the two conditions can be confused. Someone with either endometriosis or fibroids may experience severe menstrual pain, as well as pain between periods. Endometriosis occurs when the tissue that lines the womb begins to grow outside of it—usually in the pelvic cavity. It can also appear on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, on the bowels or bladder, and other nearby areas. Endometriosis is less common than uterine fibroids. One study found that about 2% of women ages 15-50 are believed to experience endometriosis. The cause of uterine fibroids is still unknown. That’s frustrating, because determining their causes could help scientists discover remedies and cures. We do know that someone who begins her periods earlier in life is more likely to experience uterine fibroids. There also seems to be an elevated risk for women who take female hormones, but this does not apply to those on birth control. While no one knows for certain what causes them, theories about the cause of leiomyomas abound. Some researchers suspect growth hormones, genetic changes, estrogen, progesterone, or cells that are misplaced during fetal development. None of these theories works to completely explain the condition, however. Research into the cause is ongoing. Uterine fibroids are classified based on exactly where they occur in the uterus. Subserosal fibroids grow outside of the uterus, and are found on the serosa. The serosa is the thin, outermost layer of the uterus. With the help of ligaments, the serosa supports the womb within the pelvic cavity. Subserosal fibroids can be either sessile or pendunculated. Pendunculated subserosal fibroids grow on small stalks that project away from the outside of the womb. Intramural fibroids are the most common type of fibroid. They form in the myometrium of the uterus. The myometrium is the middle layer of the uterus, and it is the thickest. Composed of smooth muscle, the myometrium is what contracts during a period to remove the endometrial lining. This type of leiomyoma may distort the shape of the womb. Submucosal fibroids account for about 5% of all uterine fibroids. They occur within the endometrium, the thin, innermost layer that lines the inside of the uterus. They can be either pendunculated or sessile, like subserosal fibroids. Pendunculated submucosal fibroids grow on small stalks that project into the inner uterus. Although these types are the definitions physicians use, they are limited. Most fibroids are actually hybrids spanning more than one area of the womb. You may also hear of parasitic fibroids, which receive blood from somewhere other than the uterus. Sometimes small fibroids—those smaller than four millimeters in diameter—are called seedling fibroids. Leiomyomas are very common. It is estimated that by age 50, as many as 70% to 80% of women will have them. Although their cause remains unknown, various factors indicate a higher risk of their occurrence. One risk factor is age. Once women reach their 30s and 40s, their risk increases. Women in their 30s are the ones most likely to acquire leiomyomas. After menopause, leiomyomas tend to shrink. Another risk factor is family history. When your family member has the condition, your likelihood of experiencing them increases. If that family member is your mother, your odds of developing leiomyomas is about three times higher than average. Race also plays a part in determining one’s likelihood of developing leiomyomas. African Americans are slightly more likely than whites to develop them later in life, although for women under age 35 the likelihood is about the same regardless of race. Asian women are less likely to experience associated symptoms. Diet plays another important part in the development of leiomyomas. Some foods seem to encourage them, while other foods seem to discourage them. Diets linked with a higher risk include a lot of red meat (beef, ham). Diets linked with a lower risk include plenty of green vegetables. Eating dairy products (milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream, etc.) at least once a day was shown in one large study to reduce the risk. Eating enough micronutrients, including iron, vitamin A, and vitamin D, may also help lower a patient’s risk. Because this condition can cause heavy bleeding, patients may experience anemia. Often this is mild, and can be alleviated with iron pills and diet changes. If it goes untreated though, anemia can cause exhaustion and lethargy. In severe cases, heart problems can result from anemia. Read on for more health information for battling anemia. Most women with leiomyomas have normal pregnancies. Nevertheless, leiomyomas are associated with increased risk for a range of fertility and pregnancy problems. The growths are associated with infertility, recurrent miscarriage, labor complications, and early labor. They also make breech births more likely. Because of the increase in labor complications and breech births, patients with uterine fibroids are six times more likely to give birth via caesarian section. There are a few complications of leiomyomas that will need a doctor’s care. Go see your doctor if you experience heavy periods, or if your periods become more painful. Talk to a doctor if you find it difficult to control your urination or if you urinate more frequently. If you notice the length of your periods increase for more than three cycles, or if you experience persistent heaviness or pain in your pelvis or lower abdomen, go see a doctor. Because there are often no symptoms, you may be wondering how you can know for sure if you have this condition. The answer involves a trip to the doctor. If your leiomyomas are big enough, a doctor may be able to feel them during a pelvic exam. Smaller ones can be picked up via ultrasound. Ultrasound is the most common way to diagnose leiomyomas with advanced imaging, but CT scans and MRIs are also used. Another method is saline infusion sonography, during which salt water is injected into the womb to help provide clear ultrasound images. This may become the most useful method, as it can distinguish leiomyomas from other lesions. If you are interested in becoming pregnant, your doctor may suggest a test known as a hysterosalpingogram. This test outlines the uterus and fallopian tubes and can be useful in spotting abnormalities that your gynecologist should be aware of. Since one of the common symptoms of this condition is painful periods, you may seek medication for additional care. Over-the-counter pain medicines like acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen can help ease the pain. Periods can be heavier for those with uterine fibroids. Both standard birth control pills and their low-dose counterparts can help care for the symptom of heavy bleeding. Injected birth control (including Depo-Provera) can also help control bleeding during periods. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) are another treatment used to control the development of uterine fibroids. Taken as either an injection, implant, or nasal spray, this hormone causes the amount of estrogen in the body to drop, which can cause the leiomyomas to stop growing or shrink. For this reason, GnRHa is sometimes used prior to surgery to make the tumors easier to remove. Most women do not get their periods on GnRHa drugs, which brings further relief for fibroid symptoms and can help the blood count readjust after a bout of anemia. GnRHa is usually safe for women, and most can use the hormone without any negative consequences. However some experience side effects similar to menopause symptoms, such as hot flashes, mood swings, decreased libido, sleeplessness, headaches, and joint pain. Because it can cause bone thinning, GnRHa treatment is usually limited to six months—often the six months prior to surgery. After treatment, most fibroids quickly grow back to their original size. GnRHa drugs are very expensive. Some insurance plans will require you to cover some or all of their cost. Embolization is a nonsurgical procedure that deprives the fibroids of blood, causing them to shrink. To perform an embolization, a doctor will make a small incision into the groin area in order to place a thin tube (catheter) into a large blood vessel. The tube is flexible, allowing it to snake along inside the blood vessel until it arrives near the leiomyoma, at which time a solution of tiny plastic or gel particles is injected, which blocks the blood supply to the growth. This procedure usually does not harm the uterus itself, which continues to be supplied by other blood vessels. Embolization shrinks leiomyomas by half their size or more. This therapy isn’t for everyone. The best candidates are those experiencing heavy bleeding whose uterine fibroids are causing pain or pressure on their bladders or rectums. The long-term effects on pregnancy are not fully known, though some report an increased risk of miscarriage. For this reason, embolization is only recommended for those who do not wish to become pregnant in the future. The procedure is usually safe, but can lead to complications in some cases. If the blocking solution drifts to the ovarian artery, it can cause problems with ovary functions. Some research tells us that while the treatment is generally successful, as many as one-third of patients will find that their leiomyomas reappear within five years. Surgical therapy comes down to three options: endometrial ablation, myomectomy, and hysterectomy. The lining of the uterus (the endometrium) is destroyed with endometrial ablation. This is used to remove small leiomyomas within the uterus. The procedure can be performed via freezing, laser, electric current, instrumentation, or boiling water. Often a heated balloon is used. At other times a device is employed that uses microwave energy to destroy the lining. Endometrial ablation makes pregnancy unlikely, but not impossible. When pregnancy does occur, the pregnancy carries a higher risk of miscarriage and other complications. Most women recover quickly from this outpatient procedure. About half of patients will no longer bleed during their periods. About 30% will experience much lighter bleeding. Although complications can occur, they are unusual with most methods of endometrial ablation. For women who wish to become pregnant, myomectomy is the most promising surgical option. Myomectomy removes leiomyomas while leaving healthy womb tissue intact. This surgery can be performed in a variety of ways, and may be classified as major surgery depending on the extensiveness of the procedure and the placement of the leiomyomas. For this reason complications vary depending on the details of a given procedure. One drawback to myomectomy care is that although the existing leiomyomas will be destroyed, new leiomyomas may develop develop later on. The only certain and permanent treatment for uterine fibroids is hysterectomy. About 200,000 hysterectomies are performed every year in the US for treatment of leiomyoma. Hysterectomy involves the removal of part or all of the womb, and sometimes the ovaries and fallopian tubes as well. A patient will be infertile following hysterectomy surgery. It is a major surgery, though health risks are among the lowest of all major surgeries. Nonetheless serious complications can occur, including blood clots, injury to the urinary tract and bowels, severe infection and, rarely, death. Recovery time for hysterectomy is typically several weeks. A promising treatment for leiomyomas involves the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI is used to search for the leiomyomas. Then a doctor can direct ultrasound waves at the leiomyomas in order to superheat them and shrink them. This has the advantage of sparing the surrounding uterine tissue, though it may affect the function of the ovaries. This procedure typically takes three hours. It is recommended for women who have a small number of large leiomyomas. This technique is only approved for women who do not wish to become pregnant, but some pregnancies have occurred following ultrasound therapy. About 25% of patients must return after one year for a second procedure. Women who undergo this procedure can go home the same day and usually return to their daily routine the next day. This therapy is relatively new, so some hospitals won’t offer it, and some insurance plans do not cover it. There is no known method of preventing leiomyomas, but some studies suggest exercise may be useful. A survey of about 1,200 women with the growths found that light or moderate exercise had no effect on a woman’s risk of developing the tumors. However vigorous exercise for three or more hours per week reduced the risk by 30% to 40% in this study. Another study shows a reduced risk for women who participated in sports as girls. While these studies do not conclusively prove that exercise can prevent leiomyomas, the results are interesting and merit further investigation. One study speculated that exercise could reduce the circulation of sex hormones and insulin levels, and that this may explain how regular, intense workouts could reduce the risk. Exercise also helps prevent obesity, which carries with it a higher risk of developing the tumors. One of the big challenges for many women with symptoms of this condition is keeping their iron levels in balance. Anemia is a deficiency of red blood cells. Red blood cells are iron-rich, and lack of iron (usually due to blood loss) is the most common cause of anemia. To maintain a healthy level of iron, doctors recommend a diet rich in high-iron foods such as beef, fish, poultry, leafy green vegetables, dried fruit, legumes, and nuts. A lot of food is also iron-fortified, such as many breads and cereals. Sometimes iron supplements are recommended as well. Talk to your doctor for recommendations on the healthiest ways for you to increase your iron levels. What Are Uterine Fibroids?

9b7ebf64-7cf3-4c91-b058-9e62224748a1,"| | Pregnancy Complications Raise Future Odds of Preterm Birth: Study Last Updated: May 01, 2020. FRIDAY, May 1, 2020 (HealthDay News) -- Even if their first pregnancy results in a full-term baby, women who had complications may be at increased risk of a preterm delivery next time around, researchers say. Women who deliver full-term babies are generally considered to have a low risk of delivering before 37 weeks in later pregnancies. But it wasn't clear how pregnancy complications or poor outcomes at birth might affect that risk. To find out, researchers led by Dr. Liv Kvalvik, an associate professor and fellow at the University of Bergen in Norway, analyzed data on first and second pregnancies among more than 302,000 Norwegian women between 1999 and 2015. They focused on preeclampsia (abnormally high blood pressure and excess protein in the urine); placental abruption (when the placenta comes away from the womb); stillbirth; neonatal death (within 28 days after birth), and low birth weight for gestational age. Compared to women who had none of these complications, the risk of preterm birth in the second pregnancy was twice as high among women who had one of the complications in their first pregnancy. The risk more than tripled for women who had two or more complications. The risk of preterm delivery in second pregnancy was 3% among women with no complications; 6% for those who had preeclampsia; 7% for those who had placental abruption; 13% after stillbirth; 10% for those whose newborn died within 28 days, and nearly 7% for those whose baby was small for its gestational age. The researchers pointed out that only an association rather than a cause-and-effect link was observed. In a journal news release, Kvalvik and her colleagues said the study suggests that pregnancy complications may have common underlying causes with preterm delivery that persist from pregnancy to pregnancy. The findings could help identify women at increased risk of preterm delivery, they said. The U.S. National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has more on .

ef503af1-551f-4d4c-becb-201b196efda9,"Infectious diseases are disorders caused by pathogenic microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) that may be transmitted directly or indirectly by various sources. Some infections may be harmful, but some may be harmless; all may be preventable. Certain patient populations may also be more susceptible to infections, including pregnant women. During pregnancy, some common infections that may occur are the flu, vaginal yeast infections, uterine infections, group B streptococcus, bacterial vaginosis, and listeria. Changes in immune function may cause this increased risk of infection, and if left untreated, may lead to serious complications. Complications from severe infections during pregnancy may include preterm birth, low birth weight, birth defects, learning problems, and possibly pregnancy loss. Prevention, early detection, and treatment are vital to help minimize and eliminate these complications. Infectious diseases are disorders caused by pathogenic microorganisms (e.g., bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites) that may be transmitted directly or indirectly by various sources (e.g., person to person, insects, animals, environment, food, water). Some infections may be harmful, but some may be harmless; all may be preventable. Certain patient populations, including pregnant women, may also be more susceptible to infections. During pregnancy, some common infections that may occur are influenza, vaginal yeast infections, eczema, herpes, uterine infections, group B streptococcus (GBS), bacterial vaginosis (BV), and listeria. Changes in immune function, such as reduction in T- and B-cell activity and natural killer–cell activity and increases in dendritic-cell activity, may cause this increased risk of infection. However, immune-system changes during pregnancy are not fully understood, and more data are needed. The severity of some infections, such as influenza, GBS, sexually transmitted diseases, urinary tract infections, and Zika virus, may also increase with advancing pregnancy. Complications from severe infections during pregnancy may include preterm birth, low birth weight, birth defects, learning problems, and possibly pregnancy loss. Prevention, early detection, and treatment are vital to help minimize and eliminate these complications with multiple available prevention and treatment strategies. The problem lies with growing and novel pathogens, as data are limited to devise a response plan to emerging infections such as the current pandemic. Many viral infections during pregnancy are considered benign; but due to the immunological changes that are associated with pregnancy, the severity of viral infections may increase. In addition, there is little available information about how pregnancy affects the mother’s response to viral pathogens; however, it is thought that placental response to viruses may play a role in the severity of infection. When pandemics such as influenza, Ebola, Zika, and COVID-19 occur, it becomes challenging to prevent and treat these infections with the complexity and uncertainty of immunological changes during pregnancy. Viruses and infections associated with pregnancy include herpes simplex virus (HSV); varicella zoster virus (also known as chickenpox); cytomegalovirus; rubella; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); hepatitis; influenza; and Ebola. Bacterial infections may also affect women throughout their pregnancy term and the fetus and newborn. Like viral infections, it is just as important to screen, treat, and prevent these infections to decrease complications with pregnancy. Bacteria and infections associated with pregnancy include GBS; urinary tract infections; listeriosis; syphilis; chlamydia; and bacterial vaginosis. The most common vaginal infections are listed in . BV, which is an imbalance of the normal vaginal flora with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, is the most commonly diagnosed vaginal infection. Women may be asymptomatic or report abnormal vaginal discharge and an unpleasant odor; however, infection can lead to premature labor unresponsive to tocolytic therapy. Identification and treatment may reduce the risk of preterm birth during pregnancy, and the recommended treatment for BV is oral or vaginal metronidazole or clindamycin; however, vaginal clindamycin cream is not recommended in the third or fourth trimester. This infection commonly occurs in pregnancy due to higher estrogen levels and glycogen content in vaginal secretions. Topical azole antifungals available OTC are recommended as first line with minimal risk of transfer to the fetus. A longer course of therapy of 7 days is preferred over a shorter duration. Oral fluconazole may be considered as second-line therapy; short-term use of 150 mg has not been shown to have an increased risk of malformations; however, case reports do show complications at higher doses above 400 mg. This is the most common cause of life-threatening infections in the newborn and possibly the mother. Infections that may occur include sepsis, pneumonia, or meningitis. Universal screening at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis are the key prevention strategies for GBS. If culture results are positive, treatment during labor is necessary with IV penicillin G (first-line preferred) or ampicillin (second-line option). Penicillin-allergic women may take clindamycin, vancomycin, or cefazolin as an alternative. Some rare infections may lead to serious complications. For example, primary HSV in pregnancy may lead to an increased risk of dissemination and hepatitis. Recurrence of HSV infection increases in frequency during pregnancy, which may lead to complications to the newborn post delivery. In addition, meta-analysis results show that prophylactic acyclovir beginning at 36 weeks’ gestation may reduce the risk of HSV recurrence at delivery, which may decrease risk of HSV viral shedding at delivery. When a pregnant woman infected with HIV goes into labor, the risk of transmitting HIV to the baby increases when the amniotic sac breaks. In order to protect the women’s health and also to prevent mother-to-child transmission, antiretroviral therapy against HIV infection is recommended. Guidelines recommend dolutegravir as the preferred antiretroviral therapy throughout pregnancy. Finally, syphilis in the fetus, left untreated, may cause severe complications such as stillbirth or deadly infection in the newborn. Screening is mandated early in pregnancy, and if tests are positive, treatment with penicillin G is the most effective therapy for prevention of transmission to the fetus. Pregnant women with a history of penicillin allergy are recommended to be desensitized and treated with penicillin as there are no preferred alternatives. Asymptomatic urinary tract infections may occur in 10% to15% of pregnant women and can lead to complications, including premature labor. A urine culture is best to be completed as part of the screening process during early pregnancy to help treat the infection early and prevent complications, such as pyelonephritis. If a positive culture result exists, antibiotic therapy for 7 days is recommended to treat bacteriuria as shorter therapy is less effective. Amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and cephalexin are recommended therapies for urinary tract infections (); sulfonamides and nitrofurantoin are acceptable but have use limitations (i.e., sulfonamides are not recommended towards the end of pregnancy, and nitrofurantoin is not recommended in those with G6PD deficiency). Besides vaginal and uterine infections, various other infections may occur during pregnancy that are important to note. ( also provides an overview of various other infections during pregnancy.) Pregnant women may be at risk for severe illness from influenza virus infection. During the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic, pregnant women were at an increased risk for severe disease leading to hospitalization or death; 5% of all deaths from the pandemic influenza were among pregnant women, who only represented 1% of the U.S. population at the time. When malaria is left untreated, the infection can progress to severe complications. A study of three districts in India from 2004 to 2006 showed more than 23% of maternal deaths were due to malaria, which was the most common cause of maternal death in pregnancy at that time. Due to the outbreaks that occurred in 2016, recommendations on who receives testing for Zika havebeen updated. Testing is vital, as this infection may lead to severe complications, such as encephalopathy in newborns. Testing is recommended for symptomatic pregnant women who have traveled to areas with risk of Zika. Testing may be considered if a pregnant patient is asymptomatic but has traveled to areas with risk of Zika. With the recent pandemic, the CDC has reviewed data and reports of COVID-19 results among pregnant women as part of COVID-19 surveillance. During January 22 to June 7, 2020, the CDC received reports of 326,335 women of reproductive age (15-44 years) who had positive test results for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19; of these, 8,207 women were pregnant. Data show that pregnant women might be at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness, such as respiratory illness. Symptomatic pregnant and nonpregnant women with COVID-19 reported similar frequencies of cough (>50%) and shortness of breath (30%), but pregnant women less frequently reported headache, muscle aches, fever, chills, and diarrhea. Among reproductive-age women with SARS-CoV-2 infection, pregnancy was associated with hospitalization and increased risk for ICU admission and receipt of mechanical ventilation, but not with death. To reduce COVID-19–associated illness, pregnant women should be aware of their potential risk for severe COVID-19 illness and prevention strategies that need to employed, such as not skipping prenatal care appointments, limiting interactions with other people as much as possible, and taking precautions to prevent becoming infected with COVID-19 when interacting with others. Taking medications during pregnancy may be challenging and stressful for a woman. However, benefits versus risks must be reviewed prior to prescribing and dispensing. This may be challenging in many ways, as limited data are available to help support treatment when a pregnant woman may be asymptomatic, such as in BV, which can be present in up to 20% of women during pregnancy. BV may resolve without treatment if asymptomatic; however, it may develop into persistent infection later in pregnancy if untreated. One must also be careful with which medications have been shown to cause risk to the fetus, such as sulfonamides, trimethoprim, and nitrofurantoin. Reviewing available data and alternative therapies is needed to determine the best antibiotic therapy. Infections during pregnancy are frequently benign; however, several and severe complications may occur if infections are left undetected or untreated. Monitoring for any signs and symptoms of infection during pregnancy is important, as well as following appropriate prevention and treatment strategies to help prevent the risk of complications in pregnancy and to the newborn.

Visually inspect the breasts, looking for dimpling, lumps, skin irregularities, symmetry 2. Visually inspect in several positions; may accentuate an abnormality Hands at the side Hands above the head Hands pressed onto hips Leaning over BSE positions. (From Dillon PM. (2003) Nursing Health Assessment: A Critical Thinking, Case Study Approach. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis, p. 459.) Step 2: Palpation 1. Feel the breast tissue and lymph node chain for lumps or thickening by using three finger pads while exerting light, medium, and deep pressure in a systematic fashion BSE palpation patterns. (From Dillon PM. (2003). Nursing Health Assessment: A Critical Thinking, Case Study Approach. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis, p 461.) 72. Begin by lying down on a flat surface with arm raised and a folded towel under the back of the breast being examined 3. After examining breast tissue, bring arm toward body and feel the axilla and the skin above as well as below the collar bone 4. Repeat technique on the other side 5. Report lumps, thickening, nipple discharge or any suspicious findings to health-care provider Preconception CounselingPreconception counseling should be included in health screenings for all women of childbearing age and focus on factors that impact organogenesis. Discuss chromosomal abnormalities associated with advanced maternal age Incorporate 400 mcg of folic acid daily (for low-risk women) Avoid alcohol, smoking, and drug use Teach prevention of sexually transmitted infections Update immunizations and investigate rubella titer Review exposure to environmental risk factors Control of chronic medical conditions Review classification of prescribed medication Educate women on available family planning methods, discussing the risks, benefits, and efficacy of each method Efficacy of each method influenced by correct and consistent use, user preparedness, motivation, dexterity, and comorbidities Educate women on the process of menses The menstrual cycle is a cyclic feedback system occurring approximately every 28 days with the first day of menses being day 1 Low levels of estrogen and progesterone stimulate the hypothalamus to secrete gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), encouraging maturation of the Graafian follicle Estrogen, produced by the maturing follicle, causes the endometrial lining to proliferate The mid-cycle release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary promotes release of the mature ovum (ovulation) Once ovulation occurs, the corpus luteum (remaining cells of the follicle) produces estrogen and progesterone, which stimulates endometrial thickening If conception does not occur, the corpus luteum regresses, causing a decrease in estrogen and progesterone, and ischemic changes to the functional layer of the endometrium The menstrual cycle is divided into phases of the ovarian and endometrial cycle: Ovarian CycleMenstrual Follicular Ovulatory Luteal Endometrial CycleMenstrual Proliferative Secretory Ischemic Sexual Abstinence Refraining from sexual activity is the only 100% effective way to prevent pregnancy Teaches familiarity with body in order to recognize signs of fertility Useful to avoid or achieve pregnancy, as well as monitor gynecological health To prevent pregnancy, couples abstain during recognized period of fertility 9Cervical MucusAmount and character of cervical mucus changes throughout the menstrual cycle in response to hormones Following menses, cervical mucus scant, thick, and cloudy At ovulation, cervical mucus becomes more abundant, slippery, clear, and stretchable in response to estrogen (known as spinnbarkeit), promoting sperm motility; increased likelihood of pregnancy with unprotected intercourse After ovulation, cervical mucus scant, thick, cloudy, and is no longer stretchable Cervical mucus should be evaluated and charted daily Monitor and graph BBT daily before rising Prior to ovulation, BBT decreases slightly in response to estrogen After ovulation, a surge of progesterone increases BBT by 0.51.0 F BBT remains high with conception, but falls without conception, prior to menses Certain activities may alter BBT: smoking, use of electric blanket or heated waterbed, restless sleep, illness Based on assumption that ovulation occurs 14 days before the onset of menses Record menstrual cycles for 68 months Calculate fertile period Subtract 18 from the shortest menstrual cycle (28 18 10) Subtract 11 from the longest menstrual cycle (32 11 21) Days 1021 fertile time; abstain from intercourse Prolactin suppresses follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), and therefore suppresses ovulation Postpartum woman who exclusively breastfeed during the first 6 months after childbirth, including at least one night feeding, may postpone ovulation Instruct patients that ovulation and return of fertility may occur before first menses with a risk of unintended pregnancy Barrier MethodsPrevents conception by blocking entry of sperm into the cervix Dome-shaped rubber cup with a flexible ring that fits over the cervix; regularly examine integrity of rubber Inserted with spermicide applied to dome before intercourse and left in place for at least 6 hours after intercourse Should not be left in place more than 24 hours due to risk of toxic shock syndrome Additional spermicide may be added with diaphragm still in place for repeated intercourse Diaphragm is custom fitted and must be refitted with 20 pound weight change and after a vaginal birth Urinary tract infections (UTI) more common with diaphragm use; teach to report symptoms of UTI Wash with soap and water after each use; inspect integrity of rubber by holding up to light to inspect for holes Thin latex sheath that covers the erect penis during sexual intercourse Provides protection from STIs Space should be left at the end of the condom for ejaculate Hold condom at base of the penis upon withdrawal to prevent spillage Only water-soluble gel should be used for lubrication to prevent degradation of the latex 11 New condom should be used with each act of intercourse Store in unopened package in cool, dry place Female Condom Prelubricated polyurethane sheath with two flexible rings Inner ring helps with insertion and covers the cervix Outer ring rests on vulva Water or oil-based lubricant and spermicide may be used Can be stored at any temperature; 5-year shelf life Remove prior to standing by twisting the outer ring to contain semen and pull out Material degradation could occur if both male and female condoms used simultaneously Hormonal contraceptivesHormonal contraceptives alter the normal menstrual cycle, inhibiting ovulation, altering the endometrial lining, and thickening cervical mucus. Mechanism of Action Effects of Estrogen Ovulation inhibited by suppression of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) Endometrial lining altered making the endometrium less receptive to implantation Effects of Progestin Cervical mucus thickened, hampering sperm transport Suppression of midcycle LH peak prevents ovulation Decreases cilia movement within the fallopian tube Advantages of hormonal contraceptives include decreased dysmenorrhea, decreased menstrual blood loss, and reliability Requires addition of condom for STI protection or as back-up with user error Side effects may include nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, breakthrough bleeding, headaches, mood changes, decreased libido, or weight change May cause serious health issues; advise hormonal contraceptive users not to smoke and teach reportable symptoms of possible complications: Abdominal pain (severe) Chest pain Headache (severe) Eye problems (blurred, double vision) Severe leg pain, redness, and swelling Shortness of breath Worsening depression Jaundice Contraindications to hormonal contraceptives History of heart attack, stroke, blood clot; estrogen promotes blood clotting History of breast or female reproductive cancer; tumors may be hormonally provoked Diabetes with vascular involvement; estrogen promotes blood clotting Impaired liver function; OCs are metabolized through the liver and use may adversely affect existing liver disease Suspected or confirmed pregnancy Uncontrolled hypertension; increased risk for cardiovascular complications Smoker over 35 years of age; increases the risk for cardiovascular complications History of migraine headaches (with aura); increased risk for stroke Major surgery planned with immobilization; increased risk for deep vein thrombosis Combined Hormonal Methods (Combination of estrogen and progestin) Most OCs are administered daily for 21 days, followed by 7 hormone-free days (either no pills taken or placebos taken for 7 days) Pill selection based on amount of estrogen, type of progestin, adrenergic effect, or symptoms presented 13 Combined OCs may be monophasic (estrogen and progestin remain constant) or multiphasic (hormone dosing changes throughout the month) Extended-cycle OCs are taken consistently for 12 weeks, followed by 7 days of inert pills; withdrawal bleeding occurring only four times per year Combination hormonal contraceptives may decrease production of breast milk and should be avoided while breastfeeding Effectiveness of OCs altered by certain medications; patients should report use of contraceptive agents to all health-care providers Transdermal Patch Patch applied to skin weekly for 3 weeks; fourth week is patchfree to allow withdrawal bleeding Acceptable application sites include abdomen, buttocks, upper outer arm, and upper torso (but not the breasts); site should vary weekly Application involves cleansing skin, avoiding lotion, and firmly applying patch making sure all corners adhere to skin May engage is usual activities (bathing, swimming, exercising) Partial removal and skin reactions possible Decreased effectiveness noted in women who weigh more than 198 pounds Vaginal Ring Small, flexible hormone-impregnated ring inserted and left in the vagina for 3 weeks; removed in fourth week to allow for withdrawal bleeding Ring should be kept inside unopened package before insertion; protect from sunlight and high temperatures Side effects include increase in vaginal discharge, vaginal irritation, or infection Expulsion may occur; if out for more than 3 hours, back-up method of birth control needed for the next 7 days Progestin-only preparations are indicated for women who cannot use estrogen Alteration in menstrual cycle common with progestin-only methods May be used in lactation once breastfeeding is well established Side effects include weight gain, menstrual irregularities, and depression Important to take at the same time each day Back-up method of birth control needed with missed or late pills Depo-medroxyprogesterone (DMPA) Injected by health-care provider intramuscularly (IM) every 3 months Return to fertility may be delayed Bone loss may be of concern with continued use;

vital signs every 1530 minutes Fetal heart tones every 515 minutes Pain management per primary health-care provider Pudendal block: Local anesthetic that blocks pudendal nerve to numb lower vagina and perineum for vaginal birth; useful with forcep delivery Local anesthesia to perineum: Numbs perineum for episiotomy/laceration repair Prepare for the birth of the baby Cleanse the perineum Check working order of suction equipment, oxygen, radiant warmer Neonatal resuscitation equipment should be readily available for every delivery Prepare delivery instruments Note precise time of birth Provide immediate care of the newborn Assess airway and suction as needed Remove excess fluid from infants nose and mouth (infants are obligate nose breathers) If meconium is noted in nose or mouth, endotracheal intubation and suctioning must be performed immediately Assess breathing effort (rate of at least 30 per minute) If respiratory effort is not observed, gently stimulate infant by tapping sole of foot or stroking the back Positive pressure ventilate if tactile stimulation does not result in respiratory effort Assess circulation: heart rate 100 BPM Temperature regulation Dry infant 69

If separated from newborn, initiate breast pump Breast care (nonlactating) Supportive bra, breast binder or sports bra No nipple stimulation Do not express breast milk Ice packs/analgesics for engorgement Teach breast self exam (BSE) TEACHING TIPS: BREASTFEEDING Advantages to Breastfeeding Cost Convenience Immunoglobulins, which protect the infant from infection, are passed via breast milk Decreased incidence of infant: Allergies Otitis media Upper respiratory infections Positioning The infants body should face the breast, with the ear, shoulder, and hip aligned Position pillows to support the weight of the infant Demonstrate positions for breastfeeding Supply and Demand The newborn should be fed on demand; prolactin release in response to suckling will stimulate the alveolar cells of the breast to produce the appropriate amount of milk to meet the infants needs The mother should initiate breastfeeding when the infant demonstrates hunger cues: Increased alertness or activity Smacking of the lips Suckling motion Moving of the head in search of the breast Continue to feed until the infant detaches spontaneously, burp the infant, and continue feeding on the other breast Start breastfeeding on the breast ended with the last feeding Unless medically indicated, supplemental feeding should be avoided 81Engorgement (Firm, tender breasts) May occur on postpartum day 35, when the volume of breast milk increases Prevent engorgement with frequent feedings; avoid skipping any feedings Treatment for engorgement Express a small amount of breast milk either manually or with a breast pump so that the breasts will soften and the baby can latch Apply cold packs to breasts intermittently Apply cleaned, cooled cabbage leaves to breasts until warm/wilted Warm shower or warm compress right before feeding Nutrition Add 500 calories over nonpregnant diet Continue prenatal vitamins Stay well hydrated Avoid alcohol, smoking, or recreational drugs Consult with pediatrician before using any over-the-counter or prescription medication Pumping and Storing Demonstrate use of breast pump Discuss appropriate storage containers Write the date of expression on storage container and use oldest milk first Length of storage dependent on location LocationRoom temperature Refrigerator Refrigerator freezer (with separate door) Deep freeze GuidelineUp to 8 hours 35 days 3 months 612 months Weaning Gradual weaning suggested to decrease the likelihood of engorgement Remove one feeding per week If infant is less than 1 year, infant formula, instead of cows milk, must be given Breast Care Breast pads inside a supportive bra will collect leaking breast milk Teach signs of mastitis Unilateral breast pain, warmth and redness Malaise and flu-like symptoms Fever Breastfeeding Concerns Mother should report breastfeeding concerns to the primary healthcare provider Feedings that are consistently short with the infant appearing hungry after feedings and the breasts remaining full Swallowing is inaudible once milk is established The infant is not gaining the expected amount of weight The infant has fewer than 6 wet diapers a day; urine is amber-colored Nipple pain or cracking is present Community Resources Lactation consultant La Leche League Primary health-care provider 83Uterus Uterine Involution Process by which the size of uterus decreases in a predictable pattern Documented in fingerbreadths above or below the umbilicus Postpartum Period Immediately after birth 12 hours 24 hours Day 2 Day 3U Umbilicus Level of the Fundus at the umbilicus 1 fingerbreadth (FB) above the umbilicus 1 FB below the umbilicus 2 FB below the umbilicus 3 FB below the umbilicus Measures that promote uterine involution Breastfeeding Voiding Fundal massage Oxytoxic medications Assess the tone, height, and location of the fundus TONE of the uterus assessed while patient is supine Fundus should be firmly contracted If fundus is not firm, perform fundal massage Support the lower uterine segment during massage to prevent inversion of the uterus If fundus is boggy (not firm) after massage: Check bladder status and encourage voiding Catheterize (as ordered) if unable to void Notify primary care provider Assess the HEIGHT and LOCATION of the uterus in relation to the umbilicus Immediately after birth, fundus is located at or just above the umbilicus The fundus should be midline and not deviated to the left or right Uterine involution. (From Dillon PM. (2003). Nursing Health Assessment: A Critical Thinking, Case Study Approach. Philadelphia: F Davis, .A. p. 744.) 85TEACHING TIPS: UTERINE/VAGINAL CHANGES The Fundus The fundus lowers one fingerbreadth below the umbilicus each day until returning to pelvis (day 1014) Normal Progression of Lochia Lochia progresses from bright red to brown to light pink with decreasing amount If lochia returns to bright red or increases in amount, decrease activity Persistent bright red lochia or lochia with a foul odor should be reported Report saturating one pad per hour or passing golf-ball size clots Return of the Menstrual Cycle Dependent on method of infant feeding If breastfeeding, lactation amenorrhea while exclusively breastfeeding infant (first 6 months) If bottle feeding, menses usually returns 68 weeks postdelivery Sexuality Sexual intercourse may be resumed after lochia ceased and episiotomy healed; 46 week delay generally recommended Vaginal lubrication may be diminished; use water-soluble gel Female superior or side-lying position may assist in comfort Discuss family planning methods Postpartum women may have difficulty voiding after birth due to: Decreased urethral sensation from pressure exerted by the passage of the fetus Side effects of local/epidural anesthesia Delivery trauma to the perineum Palpate for bladder distention Track fluid balance: intake and output Assess for periurethral edema/trauma Postpartum diuresis, which occurs in response to decrease in estrogen, helps rid the body of extracellular fluid and causes the bladder to fill quickly Starts within 12 hours of birth and continues for up to 5 days Urine output may be 3,000 cc/day Catheterization may be necessary if unable to void or with urinary retention Bowel Auscultate for bowel sounds Assess for abdominal distention Assess for presence/status of hemorrhoids Educate on prevention of constipation Increased roughage in the diet Increased oral intake of fluids Temporary use of prescribed stool softeners Lochia Vaginal discharge after delivery called lochia Blood loss with vaginal birth approximately 500 cc Blood loss with cesarean birth approximately 1000 cc 87 Assess the amount of lochia Note time of last perineal pad change Document amount of lochia on perineal pad (scant, small, moderate, large) If weighing perineal pads, 1 gm 1 ml of blood loss Assess the color of lochia Lochia rubra (red): day 13 Lochia serosa (brownish-pink): day 49 Lochia alba (yellow-white): day 1014 Document number and size of blood clots Turn patient to assess blood loss under buttocks Requires a direct light source and positioning of the patient in side-lying with top leg forward Assess Episiotomy or laceration Redness Swelling Ecchymosis Color, consistency of discharge Approximated edges Lacerations described by degree of tissue involvement Degree1st 2nd 3rd 4th DefinitionVaginal mucous membrane and skin of perineum Subcutaneous tissue of the perineal body Involves fibers of the external rectal sphincter Through rectal sphincter exposing the lumen of the rectum No enemas or rectal suppositories should be used with 3rd and 4th degree lacerations TEACHING TIPS: PERINEAL HYGIENE Perineal Cleansing Stress importance of hand washing before and after perineal care Demonstrate use of perineal cleansing bottle Change perineal pads after each void Keep perineal pad/underwear from touching floor Comfort Measures Apply perineal ice packs intermittently for the first 24 hours after birth Sitz baths may be ordered after 24 hours Apply creams, sprays, and ointments to perineum as ordered Discuss bowel habits and steps to avoid constipation Kegel Exercises Encourage patient to perform Kegel exercises throughout the day to strengthen perineal muscle tone To locate muscle, tighten perineal muscles as though stopping the flow of urine (this technique is only used to locate the muscles, not to perform the exercise) Hold contraction for several seconds, release, and repeat 1015 times; discourage breath-holding Emotional Response Assess interaction with newborn Eye contact with infant Talks to infant Holds infant close Feeds infant Assess emotional status Assess for postpartum blues 89TEACHING TIPS: EMOTIONS Postpartum Blues Symptoms of postpartum blues include tearfulness, insomnia, and moodiness Postpartum blues common in the early postpartum period Duration less than 2 weeks Possible cause Hormonal changes after birth Exhaustion Physical discomfort Emotional Support Encourage patient to discuss feelings Encourage private time when baby naps Discuss the difference between blues and depression;

Childrens Responses to Illness and Hospitalization Separation Anxiety Infant Develops ~6 mo and lasts until 30 mo with reactions of crying or agitation Loss of ControlDisruption of care from primary caregiver and normal routines Disruption from normal routine and rituals as well as care from parents FearsStrangers and strange places, loud noises, sudden movements, loss of physical and emotional support Strangers, dark, being alone, physical contact/interventions from strangers, strange or unknown equipment and places Mutilation, the unknown, any intrusive procedures Exhibits reactions such as agitation, temper tantrums, uncooperativeness and clinging to parents; separation anxiety peaks 1215 mo Fewer reactions but more somatic signs such as vomiting, urinary frequency or incontinence, diarrhea, dizziness; still may become withdrawn or aggressive Perceived disruption in the loss of their own power and altered family roles Childrens Responses to Illness and Hospitalization (Continued) Separation Anxiety School AgeAnxious behaviors as well as loneliness, boredom, isolation or depression; knows that parents may need to leave and will be back but may show aggression and irritability toward family Anxiety related to peers and school life with behaviors such as withdrawal, loneliness, or boredom Loss of ControlEnforced dependency and altered family roles FearsBodily injury, pain, inability to stay in control, lack of control over modesty, school and peer concerns, death Loss of peer interactions and relationships, body disfigurement, rejection by others, loss of physical abilities, death Enforced dependency and possible identity/role changes Eight Questions to Ask About Pain: 1. Are you having pain? 2. If yes, what does the pain feel like? (burning, aching, pinching, stabbing?) 3. When did the pain start? (Did anything happen to start the pain?) 4. Where is the pain? (Point to where the pain is.) 5. How long have you been having pain? 6. How often does it occur? 7. Does anything make it worseor better? 8. Has it changed what you do? Developmental Differences in Children Related to Pain Age Infants Comments Preverbal. Signs of possible pain: diffuse body movement, high-pitched cry, tearing, stiff posture, fisting, and lack of play; obvious sign is facial expression with brows lowered and drawn together, eyes tightly closed, and mouth open Limited vocabularies still make it difficult to express pain; may use words such as owie; can sometimes describe pain but not the intensity. Signs of possible pain: regression with arms and legs thrashing or withdrawal such as clinging to parent or significant other, loud crying or screaming Use pain scale for this group; may have difficulty in distinguishing between types of pain such as sharp or dull; may act tough even when in pain; may show fewer overt pain behaviors. Signs of possible pain: muscular rigidity such as clenched fists, gritted teeth, body stiffness, closed eyes, wrinkled forehead or lying in fetal position Use pain scale for this group; may be stoic because of fear of being labeled so may be quiet and withdrawn. Signs of possible pain: fist-clenching, clenched teeth, rapid breathing, and guarding affected body part, lack of interest and decreased ability to concentrate 119Nursing Interventions Related To Pain Management Distractionuseful for mild pain relief (example: tell child to say Oh when giving an injection or blow bubbles when performing a procedure) Guided imageryaid the child in creating a pleasurable mental image during the painful situation Thought stoppingstop the painful thought with a positive thought Soothing music or aromatherapyuse to calm emotions and state of mind Thermotherapyapply warm and cold to painful areas to promote circulation or reduce edema with limited numbing effect Gentle massagerelax or focus child away from pain toward more gentle soothing touch Sucrose Sweet Nipplecalm young infants by allowing them to suck on nipple dipped in sucrose solutioneffective method in reducing pain during procedure Provide ordered pharmacological interventions such as topical anesthetic creams, PO/IV/IM analgesia, patientcontrolled analgesia (PCA), conscious sedation, or epidural analgesia None 012345678910 Worst Pain (Scale of 010 to describe pain) Explain to older child: 0 means you feel no pain and 10 means you feel the worst pain possible. Ask the child to choose number that best describes his or her own pain. 0No particular expression or smile Normal position or relaxed Lying quietly, normal position, moves easily No cry (awake or asleep) Content, relaxed 1Occasional grimace or frown, withdrawn, disinterested Uneasy, restless, tense Squirming, shifting back and forth, tense Moans or whimpers, occasional complaint Reassured by occasional touching, hugging, or talking to, distractible no pain, 10 worst pain. 2Frequent to constant frown, clenched jaw, quivering chin Kicking, or legs drawn up Arched back, rigid or jerking Crying steadily, screams or sobs, frequent complaints Difficult to console or comfort From Merkel S, Voepel-Lewis T, Shayevitz J, Malviya, S.

ALIVE? In the crib or hanging from the sides? (Children can do amazing stunts!) Are the parents with the child? What type of equipment is at the bedside? Is the child breathing? Do you observe any signs of distress? (Follow the ABCs you learned in CPR) What is the childs color? (pale, red, blue ) Is the child on a monitor? (What is the rate & pattern?) Any IVs? (Note type, rate, & site) Note last set of vital signs (Include other findings based on childs condition, PIC line, chest tubes, and so on) Abnormal? If so, check again. When was the last time the child voided? Do you observe anything unusual that needs immediate interventions? DO IT NOW! Are the monitor and respirator alarms set at the proper limits? Is the 02 set up correctly? Does it work? Is the suction equipment set up and ready to be used? TEST IT! Is there an appropriate resuscitation bag with the proper size mask? Is the correct equipment at the bedside for the child on seizure precautions? Are the crib rails up? Are restraints applied correctly? (Is there an order for the restraints?) Are tabletops and crib or bed cleared of unsafe articles? This initial assessment takes about 23 minutes. Do the same initial assessment on all patients then return to do the more in-depth assessment. If the patient is in critical condition do the in-depth assessment NOW! Quick Evaluation of Sick Child Observation Quality of Cry Normal Strong normal tone or content and not crying Cries briefly, then content and not crying If awake, stays awake; if asleep and stimulated, quickly wakes Pink Skin warm and dry, eyes and mouth moist Smiles; alert Moderate ImpairmentWhimpering or sobbing Cries off and on Severe ImpairmentWeak, moaning, or high pitched Continual cry or hardly responds Will not rouse or falls to sleep Eyes close briefly then awakens, or wakes with prolonged stimulation Pale hands, feet or acrocyanosis Skin and eyes normal and mouth slightly dry Brief smile; or briefly alert Pale or blue or gray or mottled Skin doughy or tented and eyes sunken and dry No smile, anxious face, not alert From McCarthy PL, Sharpe MR, Spiesel SZ, et al. (1982). Observation scales to identify serious illness in febrile children. Pediatrics; 78: 802. Communication with Child and Family Age Group Infant Important AspectsTrust is developing; communicates through coos, smiles, and cries at first. First words around 89 mo. Understands simple one word commands at 1 yr. If primary caregiver is comfortable, many times the infant is calm and trusting. Allow infant to be held by caregiver as much as possible. Sense of self and being independent is becoming important; understands simple two- and three-word commands. Has 300 word vocabulary. Short attention span of 15 minutes. ExamplesProvide gentle touching; firm holding, and smiles to infant. Speak to primary caregiver first. If not contraindicated, offer pacifier and use security blankets and stuffed animals. First, direct eyes and questions to caregiver. Assume eye level of child. Ask simple questions with appropriate choices such as would you like to sit on your mothers lap or up on the table? Use childs language for specific words in short and simple sentences. Be attentive to nonverbal cues. Use puppets and dolls.(Continued text on following page) Communication with Child and Family (Continued) Age Group Preschooler Important AspectsDeveloping a concept of self; understands simple sentences. Has 900 words in vocabulary. Let children know that they did not cause the illness. Prepare child for procedure right before the treatment. Interested in achievement; get child to help you. Understands most mature thoughts especially when allowed to manipulate and see objects. Transition between childhood and adulthood; begin conversation with them first then ask questions of caregivers. Verify with adolescent that they understand. Can use brochures and videos. ExamplesAssume eye level of child. Provide appropriate choices. Offer appropriate medical equipment for play to reduce fear of equipment. Use concrete sentences. Allow child to ask questions. Show the child equipment and use clear simple instructions. Use teaching aids and explain what you do. Would you like to have your mother leave the room while I examine you? Provide privacy and ensure confidentiality.

HEENT Eyes (redness, drainage, alignment) Ears (response to sound, pulling at ears) Mouth (excessive drooling, white patches in mouth) Neuro Level of alertness, affect, and responsiveness (awake, verbalizes, awareness of surroundings, lethargic, obtunded, etc.) Pupil check (darken room before trying to check, simultaneous closing of eyelids, movements of eyesany deviations to right or left, color of sclera and conjunctiva, any drainage, visual acuity) Movement of extremities (involuntary, voluntary, on verbal commandfor older child, moves in response to painful or other stimuli, uncoordinated movements, twitches, tremors) Hand grasps and pedal pushes (equality, remember you need to adapt to developmental age) Reflexesdeep tendon reflexes, presence or absence of newborn reflexes Speech (clear, slurred, etc.) Signs of seizure activity (describe type, how often, when, etc.) Nuchal rigidity Head circumference and size of fontanels (adapt to the developmental age) Respiratory Inspect shape and contour of chest (expose the patients chest to get a good look! Posture, spinal curvature, any equipment such as chest tubesif present, describe site, type, etc.) Palpate expansion of chest for full and equal excursion (Inspect for retractions, unequal expansion, etc.) Respirationseasy, quiet, unlabored? Abdominal breathing? (Children are often abdominal breathers until 67 yr) Auscultate the lungs from the top to the bottom, front and back and laterally, include over the neck and trachea (compare right and left sides, abnormal soundsdescribe) Does child breathe through nose or mouth (any drainage? if present describe amount, color, and consistency) Note Pulse oximetry (%02 saturation) Ventilatorstart at the nearest point to the patientET or trach and work distally toward the machine Size of ET or trach tube, whether tube is cuffed, amount of air in cuff for seal, whether seal is intact, appearance of trach site, tube placement, equality of bilateral lung expansion, quality and equality of breath sounds, tubing and integrity of connections Make sure there is no water in the tubes, know tidal volume, measure O2 concentration Note settings your patient is oncheck the system pressures any change needed? Recheck all settings and alarms. Is the alarm on? Suction the patient, if needed. Observe the patients tolerance to the procedure and type and amount of secretions Check other O2 equipment such as croup tents, etc. Do you have the right set-up? Proper concentration of O2? Water in containers that should have water? Patients tolerance to the equipment? Is there any cyanosis? Cardiovascular Inspect and palpate the point of maximum impulse (PMI) Auscultate the heart sounds. What is rate and rhythm? Run a strip if you can. Check the P QRS, and T wavesany , abnormalities? Are all peripheral pulses present and equal? Any edema? (Check dependent areas like the sacral area) Any signs of dehydration? (Sunken fontanels, lethargic, sunken eyes, mucous membranes, etc.) Overall perfusion? (Skin warm, dry and pink? Or cool, clammy, mottled?) Nail beds(Good capillary refill, pink, etc.?) Check IV sites for signs of infiltration, phlebitis, etc., type and rate of IV, infusion pump, etc. Hemodynamic monitoring: various line(Note the reading, equipment, sites, and dressing) Posterior tibialAuscultation areas and peripheral pulses. Start from nose and mouth and work down. NG tube (Inspect for patency, how long has it been in, any suctioning-type, any drainagedescribe odor, amount, color, consistency, pH, quaiac, and so on)? Any other type of GI drainage? Abdomen (Inspect, auscultate bowel sounds in all four quadrants, palpate and percuss for size, consistency [soft or firm], distention, rigidity, pain [location, intensity, quality]). Stool inspect for amount, color, consistency, guaiac, reducing substance, when did child last have one? To decrease ticklish or tense sensation, have child place feet flat on bed or table with knees elevated and place childs hand under your hand as you palpate and percuss GU Foley (Describe type, when inserted, does it need to be changed?). Foley care? Any urine? (What does it look like color, clarity, sediment or blood present? Test it forspecific gravity, glucose, pH, etc.) Do you observe any urethral, penile, vaginal discharge Circumcised? Determine weight of diaper: 1 g 1 cc (first weigh dry diaper and deduct weight of dry diaper) Skin Look at it!! All of it. Rashes, lesionslocation, pattern, size, color elevation, blanching? Breakdown?? Petechiae, purpura, bruising? General skin conditiondry, oily, itchy, scaly? Skin turgor? Lice? Color of the skin, any cyanosis, temperature, moisture? Note dressings (dry and intact??) Note mucous membranes (hydration, color) Tongue (is it moist?) 133Musculoskeletal Assess while doing other systems Note if child is walking, sitting, or turning, ROM in all joints Check spinal curvature and mobility, sacral dimples or tufts of hair Note strength, symmetry, and movement of extremities Infant Car seats. Water temperature (water heater setting lower than 130 F), smoke detectors, bath safety Car seats, pedestrian safety, water safety, medications, and household poisons Pedestrian safety, bicycle helmets, seat belts, no firearms in household, water safety Auto safety, alcohol/drug use, occupational injuries, no firearms in household Right Drug Right Dose Right Time Right Route Right Patient Variations based on age, weight, body surface area (BSA), and maturity of kidneys and liver Physician orders, dosage, and route Nurse checks for safety of dosage and route Determine childs weight in kg Establish safe dose from pharmacy text Calculate dose using weight Use nomogram to determine where straight line connects height and weight levels and bisects the BSA Divide the BSA in meters by 1.7 Multiply the quotient from step 2 by the adult dose Administration of Medication Check for drug allergy history prior to administration Check ID band; do not ask child to verbally identify himself; child may say yes to any name or give false name to avoid taking medication; do not use name card on bed to ID childchildren may switch beds 135 Give choices when possiblewould you like to take your medicine with water or juice? Ask parent for suggestions regarding how child prefers to take medication Allow parent to give medication if child prefersbe sure to observe while entire dose is administered NEVER leave med at beside Oral Route (by mouth) Use tool that ensures accurate measurement: calibrated dropper, syringe with needle removed, or plastic measuring cup Take care to prevent aspirationhold childs head up and administer liquids to infant by carefully using a syringe or dropper to place small amounts of med into infants cheek, near back of mouth or by putting med into nipple for infant to suck. Be prepared to suction med back into a small syringe for oral administration if infant does not suck nipple Do not dilute med in formula or large amount of liquid that infant may not consume May use small amount of flavored syrup to disguise unpleasant tastes Nasogastric (NG), Orogastric, or Gastrostomy Route Crush pills finely to prevent clogging of tube Check tube placement and infuse slowly After med administration, flush line with water to ensure med has cleared tube and to prevent clogging Ensure that med is room temperature DropsPlace med in conjunctival sac; apply slight pressure to inner puncta for 1 minute to keep drops from draining into nose If child is uncooperative, immobilize childs head, place drop(s) over inner punctamed will drain into eye when child opens his eye.

Use anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and phenytoin to control seizures. Starts in one focal area and spreads to both hemispheres; consciousness not completely lostconfusion, aura may occur, postictal response. Use anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine or phenytoin to control seizures; may need more than one drug. Sudden onset, lasts 510 sec, loose responsiveness but no falling, eyelids twitching, lip smacking, no postictal response; anticonvulsants/ketogenic diet. Opposite muscles contract/relax in rhythmic pattern, may occur in one or more limbs; use anticonvulsants. Muscles maintain continuous contracted state (rigid posture) with variable loss of consciousness; use anticonvulsants. Violent total body tonic then clonic movements with aura and postictal response, loss of consciousness. Phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin, or other similar drugs may be combinations.(Continued text on following page) Drop and fall attack with loss of posture tone. Must wear helmet and use anticonvulsants. Elevated temp leads to seizure activity 5 minutes in young infants and children, generalized, transient and nonprogressive. Treat underlying illness/fever, diazepam PO, monitor for neurological deficits. Prolonged or repetitive seizures without interruption lasting longer than 30 minutes that results in anoxia, cardiac and respiratory arrest; loss of consciousness. Assess airway, breathing, circulation. IV glucose and other drugs such as diazepam, phenytoin, phenobarbital used to control problem within 2060 minutes, correct metabolic problems, may start midazolam drip, treat underlying cause, establish maintenance anticonvulsant drugs. For All Seizures: Do: Stay with child; call for help; move to flat surface out of danger; position on side with head supported and clothing loosened. Maintain patent airway; record seizure activity and assess neurological status and vital signs; document time started and ended, auraif present, color change, presence of incontinence, oral tissue damage (if any), postictal (postseizure) response. Do Not: Try to interrupt seizure or restrain child; use tongue blades. 151Degree and Signs of Fluid Deficit (Dehydration) in Children Common Clinical SignsSkin Pale, mottled, cool Decreased Mottled to cyanotic, cool Markedly decreased, tenting Sunken, no tear production Very dry and cracked Sunken Mucous membranes Anterior fontanel (if still open) Heart rate Appears sunken, poor tear production Dry Slightly depressed Increased Respiratory rate Blood pressure Capillary refill Mental status Urine output Normal Normal Normal Alert but may be irritable Decreased Increased Slight decreased Slight delay Irritable, restless Oliguria Increased, pulse often not palpable Increased Decreased Delayed ( 4sec) Lethargic to comatose Oliguria to anuria Water Deficit % Dehydration Childs Weight Sodium Deficit Water Deficit 80 mEq/L Potassium Deficit Water Deficit 30 mEq/LFrom Behrman RE, Kliegman RM, Jenson TB.

If you have had a C-section and would like information about how a cesarean affects future deliveries, see the topic . A cesarean section is the delivery of a baby through a cut (incision) in the mother's belly and . It is often called a C-section. In most cases, a woman can be awake during the birth and be with her newborn soon afterward. See a picture of a . If you are pregnant, chances are good that you will be able to deliver your baby through the birth canal (vaginal birth). But there are cases when a C-section is needed for the safety of the mother or baby. So even if you plan on a vaginal birth, it's a good idea to learn about C-section, in case the unexpected happens. A C-section may be planned or unplanned. In most cases, doctors do cesarean sections because of problems that arise during labor. Reasons you might need an unplanned C-section include: The baby shows signs of distress, such as a very fast or slow heart rate. A problem with the placenta or umbilical cord puts the baby at risk. When doctors know about a problem ahead of time, they may schedule a C-section. Reasons you might have a planned C-section include: The baby is not in a head-down position close to your due date. You have a problem such as heart disease that could be made worse by the stress of labor. You have an infection that you could pass to the baby during a vaginal birth. You are carrying more than one baby (). You had a C-section before, and you have the same problems this time or your doctor thinks labor might cause your scar to tear (uterine rupture). In some cases, a woman who had a C-section in the past may be able to deliver her next baby through the birth canal. This is called . If you have had a previous C-section, ask your doctor if VBAC might be an option this time. In the past 40 years, the rate of cesarean deliveries has jumped from about 1 out of 20 births to about 1 out of 3 births. This trend has caused experts to worry that C-section is being done more often than it is needed. Because of the risks, experts feel that C-section should only be done for medical reasons. Most mothers and babies do well after C-section. But it is major surgery, so it carries more risk than a normal vaginal delivery. Some possible risks of C-section include: Problems from the anesthesia, such as nausea, vomiting, and severe headache. Breathing problems in the baby if it was delivered before its due date. If she gets pregnant again, a woman with a C-section scar has a small risk of the scar tearing open during labor (uterine rupture). She also has a slightly higher risk of a problem with the , such as . Before a C-section, a needle called an is put in one of the mother's veins to give fluids and medicine (if needed) during the surgery. She will then get medicine (either or ) to numb her belly and legs. Fast-acting , which makes the mother sleep during the surgery, is only used in an emergency. After the anesthesia is working, the doctor makes the incision. Usually it is made low across the belly, just above the pubic hair line. This may be called a ""bikini cut."" Sometimes the incision is made from the navel down to the pubic area. See a picture of . After lifting the baby out, the doctor removes the placenta and closes the incision with stitches. How long does it take to recover from a C-section? Most women go home 3 to 5 days after a C-section, but it may take 4 weeks or longer to fully recover. By contrast, women who deliver vaginally usually go home in a day or two and are back to their normal activities in 1 to 2 weeks. Before you go home, a nurse will tell you how to care for the incision, what to expect during recovery, and when to call the doctor. In general, if you have a C-section: You will need to take it easy while the incision heals. Avoid heavy lifting, intense exercise, and sit-ups. Ask family members or friends for help with housework, cooking, and shopping. You will have pain in your lower belly and may need pain medicine for 1 to 2 weeks. You can expect some vaginal bleeding for several weeks. (Use sanitary pads, not tampons.) Call your doctor if you have any problems or signs of infection, such as a fever or red streaks or pus from your incision. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems.

The hospital may send you instructions on how to get ready for your surgery, or a nurse may call you with instructions before your surgery. In preparation for a cesarean section, your arms are secured to the table for your safety, and a curtain is hung across your chest. A tiny tube is placed in your arm or hand; you may be given a through the IV to help you relax. A is inserted into your to allow you to pass urine during and after the surgery.

Medical reasons for a planned cesarean may include: A fetus in any position that is not head-down (including ). For more information, see the topic . Decreased blood supply to the before birth, which may lead to a small baby. A maternal disease or condition that may be made worse by the stress of labor. One example is heart disease. A known health problem with the baby, such as . A placenta that is blocking the (). For more information, see the topic .

Depending on the reason for a planned C-section and the risks to you or your baby, the C-section may be scheduled near your due date or weeks before. Talk to your doctor to learn about the timing that is best for your situation. Some women request to have a C-section even though they have never had one before and there is no medical need for it. This is called an elective primary C-section. Because of the risks of C-section, experts recommend that C-sections generally be done only for medical reasons. If you're thinking of having a C-section for personal reasons, you may want to talk to your doctor about reasons for and against an elective primary C-section. Some unplanned cesareans happen when there is a problem before or during labor. Sometimes this is an emergency. Medical reasons for an unplanned cesarean may include: Fetal distress (suggested by a very rapid or very slow heart rate). , which can cause excessive bleeding (hemorrhage) and decreased oxygen supply to the fetus. For more information, see the topic . problems that decrease or cut off fetal blood supply, as when the cord has slipped into the birth canal ahead of the fetus, and the fetus moves into the birth canal and presses against the cord (cord prolapse). Cesarean section is considered relatively safe. But it does pose a higher risk of some complications than does a vaginal delivery. If you have a cesarean section, expect a longer recovery time than you would have after a vaginal delivery. After cesarean section, the most common complications for the mother are: Nausea, vomiting, and severe headache after the delivery (related to anesthesia and the abdominal procedure). Bowel problems, such as constipation or when the intestines stop moving waste material normally (). Injury to another organ (such as the bladder). This can occur during surgery. Maternal death (very rare). About 2 in 100,000 cesareans result in maternal death. Need for special care in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Immature lungs and breathing problems, if the due date has been miscalculated or the infant is delivered before . While most women recover from both cesarean and vaginal births without complications, it takes more time and special care to heal from cesarean section, which is a major surgery. Women who have a cesarean section without complications spend about 3 days in the hospital, compared with about 2 days for women who deliver vaginally. Full recovery after a cesarean delivery takes 4 to 6 weeks. Full recovery after a vaginal delivery takes about 1 to 2 weeks. Women who have a uterine cesarean scar have slightly higher long-term risks. These risks, which increase with each additional cesarean delivery, include: Breaking open of the incision scar during a later pregnancy or labor (uterine rupture). For more information, see the topic . , the growth of the placenta low in the uterus, blocking the cervix. , , (least to most severe). These problems occur when the placenta grows deeper into the uterine wall than normal, which can lead to severe bleeding after childbirth, and sometimes may require a .

You can feed and care for your newborn as you feel able. Before going home, you'll receive postsurgery instructions, including warning signs of complications. It can take 4 weeks or more for a cesarean incision to heal, and it isn't unusual to have occasional pains in the area during the first year after the surgery. It is important to take care of yourself at home while you are healing. Rest when you feel tired. Getting enough sleep will help you recover. Try to walk each day. Start by walking a little more than you did the day before. Bit by bit, increase the amount you walk. Walking boosts blood flow and helps prevent pneumonia, constipation, and blood clots. Avoid strenuous activities, such as bicycle riding, jogging, weightlifting, and aerobic exercise, for 6 weeks or until your doctor says it is okay. Until your doctor says it is okay, do not lift anything heavier than your baby. Do not do sit-ups or other exercises that strain the belly muscles for 6 weeks or until your doctor says it is okay.

If your stomach is upset, try bland, low-fat foods like plain rice, broiled chicken, toast, and yogurt. Drink plenty of fluids (unless your doctor tells you not to). You may notice that your bowel movements are not regular right after your surgery. This is common. Try to avoid constipation and straining with bowel movements. You may want to take a fiber supplement every day. If you have not had a bowel movement after a couple of days, ask your doctor about taking a mild laxative. If you have strips of tape on the incision, leave the tape on for a week or until it falls off. Wash the area daily with warm, soapy water, and pat it dry. Other cleaning products, such as hydrogen peroxide, can make the wound heal more slowly. You may cover the area with a gauze bandage if it weeps or rubs against clothing. Change the bandage every day. For information about how a cesarean affects future deliveries, see the topic . Call anytime you think you may need emergency care. For example, call if: You have thoughts of harming yourself, your baby, or another person. You have sudden chest pain and shortness of breath, or you cough up blood. Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if: You have bright red vaginal bleeding that soaks one or more pads each hour for 2 or more hours.

You have trouble passing urine or stool, especially if you have pain or swelling in your lower belly. You feel sad, tearful, or hopeless for more than a few days, or you have troubling or dangerous thoughts. Some women feel shoulder pain for days after a cesarean section.

These include: History of cesarean. Some women with a cesarean scar can deliver vaginally, although there are risks involved in a . Some smaller hospitals no longer provide VBAC, reflecting a trend toward greater medical caution with VBAC. If you have had a previous cesarean, weigh the benefits and risks of vaginal delivery with your doctor or midwife. For more information, see the topic . Fetal distress.

This topic covers pregnancy information, including planning for labor and delivery. If you aren't pregnant yet, see the topic . For more information on labor and delivery, see the topic . You may be happy and excited to find out that you're pregnant. And you may be a little nervous or worried. If this will be your first child, you may even feel overwhelmed by all of the things you need to know about having a baby. There is a lot to learn. But you don't have to know everything right away. You can read all about pregnancy now, or you can learn about each stage as your pregnancy goes on. Pregnancy is measured in from the first day of your last menstrual period, totaling 40 weeks. Most babies are born at 37 to 42 weeks. During your pregnancy, you'll have tests to watch for certain problems that could occur. With all the tests you'll have, you may worry that something will go wrong. But most women have healthy pregnancies. If there is a problem, these tests can find it early so that you and your doctor or midwife can treat it or watch it to help improve your chance of having a healthy baby. Taking great care of yourself is the best thing you can do for yourself and your baby. Everything healthy that you do for your body helps your growing baby. Rest when you need it, eat well, and exercise regularly. Drink plenty of water before, during, and after you are active. This is very important when it's hot out. You'll need to have regular checkups. At every visit, your doctor or midwife will weigh you and measure your belly to check your baby's growth. You'll also get blood and urine tests and have your blood pressure checked. It's important to avoid tobacco smoke, alcohol and drugs, chemicals, and radiation (like X-rays). These can harm you and the baby. Your first prenatal exam gives your doctor or midwife important information for planning your care. You'll have a pelvic exam and urine and blood tests. You'll also have your blood pressure and weight checked. The urine and blood tests are used for a pregnancy test and to tell whether you have low iron levels (are ) or have signs of infection. At each prenatal visit you'll be weighed, have your belly measured, and have your blood pressure and urine checked. Go to all your appointments. Although these quick office visits may seem simple and routine, your doctor is watching for signs of possible problems like high blood pressure. In some medical centers, you can have screening in your first trimester to see if your baby has a chance of having or another genetic problem. The test usually includes a blood test and an . During your second trimester, you can have a blood test (triple or quadruple screen test) to see if you have a higher-than-normal chance of having a baby with birth defects. Based on the results of the tests, you may be referred to a geneticist for further discussion. Or you may have other tests to find out for sure if your baby has a birth defect. Late in your second trimester, your blood sugar will be checked for diabetes during pregnancy (). Near the end of your pregnancy, you will have tests to look for infections that could harm your newborn. What changes can you expect in your body and your emotions? You will go through some amazing changes during pregnancy. Your body, emotions, and relationships will all do some growing. These changes are common, but some may be a challenge. Every woman feels these changes in her own way. Even the way she changes can change. In the beginning of your pregnancy, you may feel so tired that you can barely keep your head up. But at other times, you may have trouble sleeping. Many women feel nauseated in the morning (morning sickness) or at other times of day in the early part of pregnancy. But some women never have this problem. Your breasts will get larger and may feel tender. Throughout your pregnancy, you may get heartburn or crave certain foods, and you may have aches and pains.

Pregnancy is a time of many changes. Your body will go through a lot on the way to creating a new person. Normal physical changes and symptoms throughout pregnancy Although they can range from mild to severe, the following conditions are common during pregnancy: Changes in vaginal discharge. A thin, milky-white discharge (leukorrhea) is normal throughout pregnancy. Also, the tissues lining the vagina become thicker and less sensitive during pregnancy. Hand pain, numbness, or weakness (carpal tunnel syndrome) The first trimester of pregnancy lasts from week 1 through week 12. Your first sign of pregnancy may be a missed menstrual period. Other early signs of pregnancy, caused by hormonal changes, include: Nausea with or without vomiting, also known as . The second trimester of pregnancy (from week 13 to week 27) is the time when most women start to look pregnant and may begin to wear maternity clothes. By 16 weeks, the top of your uterus, called the fundus, will be about halfway between your pubic bone and your navel. By 27 weeks, the fundus will be about or more above your navel. You may find that the second trimester is the easiest part of pregnancy. For some women, the breast tenderness, morning sickness, and fatigue of the first trimester ease up or disappear during the second trimester, while the physical discomforts of late pregnancy have yet to start. Pressure on your bladder may be less as the uterus grows up out of the pelvis. Common symptoms you may experience during the second trimester of pregnancy include: (also a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD). Hand pain, numbness, or weakness (carpal tunnel syndrome). , which are ""warm-up"" contractions that do not thin and open the cervix (do not lead to labor). The third trimester lasts from week 28 to the birth. Many women have some discomfort during this time as their belly gets bigger. You might have trouble getting comfortable so you can sleep. And you might have a few other aches and pains. Common symptoms you may experience during the third trimester include: , which are ""warm-up"" contractions that do not thin and open the cervix (do not lead to labor). (a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD). Hand pain, numbness, or weakness (carpal tunnel syndrome). Breathing difficulty, since your uterus is now just below your rib cage, and your lungs have less room to expand. of your feet and ankles (edema). Pregnancy causes more fluid to build up in your body. This, plus the extra pressure that your uterus places on your legs, can lead to swelling in your feet and ankles. and finding a comfortable position. Lying on your back interferes with blood circulation, and lying on your stomach isn't possible. Sleep on your side, using pillows to support your belly and between your knees. Later in your pregnancy, it is best to lie on your left side. When you lie on your right side or on your back, the increasing weight of your uterus can partly block the large blood vessel in front of your backbone. Frequent urination, caused by your enlarged uterus and the pressure of the fetus's head on your bladder. Pregnancy is measured in trimesters from the first day of your last menstrual period, totaling 40 weeks. The first trimester of pregnancy is week 1 through week 12, or about 3 months. The second trimester is week 13 to week 27. And the third trimester of pregnancy spans from week 28 to the birth. Your baby will change from week to week. To learn more about how your baby is changing each month and about what tests you might think about having, see the . During the week after fertilization, the fertilized egg grows into a microscopic ball of cells (blastocyst), which implants on the wall of your uterus. This implantation triggers a series of hormonal and physical changes in your body. The third through eighth weeks of growth are called the embryonic stage, during which the develops most major body organs. During this process, the embryo is especially vulnerable to damaging substances, such as alcohol, radiation, and infectious diseases. Having reached a little more than in length by the ninth week of growth, the embryo is called a . By now, the uterus has grown from about the size of a fist to about the size of a grapefruit. The first trimester is a time of amazing development. The embryo starts out looking like a tiny seed, then a tadpole with a tail, and then more human. If this is your first pregnancy, you'll begin to feel your fetus move at about 18 to 22 weeks after your last menstrual period. Although your fetus has been moving for several weeks, the movements have not been strong enough for you to notice until now. At first, fetal movements can be so gentle that you may not be sure what you are feeling. If you've been pregnant before, you may notice movement earlier, sometime between weeks 16 and 18. During this time, the fetus is still building up body fat and starting to put on a lot of weight. , your fetus is about long and weighs about . The third trimester of pregnancy spans from week 28 to the birth. The fetus moves frequently, especially between the 27th and 32nd weeks. After week 32, a fetus becomes too big to move around easily inside the uterus and may seem to move less. Your due date marks the end of your 40th week. Most babies are born at 37 to 42 weeks. During this final trimester, your fetus grows larger and the body organs mature. , a fetus usually settles into a head-down position in the uterus. You will likely feel some discomfort as you get close to delivery. The emotional experience of pregnancy is different for every woman. It's common to have mixed emotions and to feel uncertain—even if your pregnancy was planned.

External Cephalic Version (Version) for Breech Position External Cephalic Version (Version) for Breech Position External cephalic version, or version, is a procedure used to turn a fetus from a or side-lying (transverse) position into a head-down (vertex) position before labor begins. When successful, version makes it possible for you to try a vaginal birth. Version is done most often before labor begins, typically around 37 weeks. Version is sometimes used during labor before the has ruptured. A scheduled cesarean is used to deliver most breech births if a version doesn't work. To avoid harm to the fetus, a version procedure is closely monitored. is first used to confirm the fetus's position, where the is, and the amount of . Fetal ultrasound is often used to watch the fetal position during the version attempt. is used before, possibly during, and after a version attempt. An active fetus whose heart rate increases normally with movement is usually considered to be healthy. If the fetus's heart rate becomes abnormal, the version procedure may be stopped. Before the version attempt, you may be given an injection of to relax the uterus and prevent uterine contractions. The most commonly used tocolytic medicine is terbutaline. While the uterus is relaxed, your doctor will attempt to turn the fetus. With both hands on the surface of your abdomen—one by the fetus's head and the other by the buttocks—the doctor pushes and rolls the fetus to a head-down position. You will feel discomfort during a version procedure, especially if it causes the uterus to contract. The amount of discomfort depends on how sensitive your abdomen is and how hard the doctor presses on your abdomen during the version attempt. If your fetus appears to be in distress, as shown by a sudden drop in heart rate, the procedure is stopped. If a first attempt at version is not successful in turning the fetus, your doctor may suggest another attempt, possibly with to help you relax and to reduce pain associated with the procedure. Epidural anesthesia may increase the success of repeated version attempts. Serious complications are rare during external cephalic version. But they do happen. This is why a version is performed in a hospital where you can have an emergency C-section delivery if needed. You and your fetus may be monitored for a short time after a version attempt. You can resume your normal activities after the procedure is over. The mother is 36 to 42 weeks pregnant. Before 36 weeks, a fetus is likely to turn back into a head-down position on its own. But version may be more successful if it is done as early as possible after 36 weeks because the fetus is smaller and is surrounded by more amniotic fluid and space to move in the uterus. The fetus has not dropped into the pelvis (has not engaged). A fetus that has engaged is very difficult to move. There is enough amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus for turning the fetus. If the amount of amniotic fluid is below normal (oligohydramnios), the fetus is more likely to be injured during a version attempt. The mother has been pregnant before. A previous pregnancy usually means that the wall of the abdomen is more flexible and can stretch during a version attempt. Version may also be attempted if the mother has not been pregnant before. The fetus is in the position. The mother has a condition (such as a heart problem) that prevents her from receiving certain tocolytic medicines to prevent uterine contractions. A cesarean delivery is needed, such as when the placenta partially or completely covers the cervix () or has separated from the wall of the uterus (). Fetal monitoring shows that the fetus may not be doing well. The fetus has a hyperextended head. This means that the neck is straight, rather than bending the head forward with the chin tucked into the chest. The fetus is known or suspected to have a birth defect. The mother is pregnant with multiple fetuses (twins, triplets, or more). Version may pose a slight risk of opening a previous C-section scar. Limited research data have shown that women with a cesarean scar have had no such problems. But larger studies are needed to fully assess the risk. In some cases, a doctor will choose not to try a version when there is less amniotic fluid than normal (oligohydramnios) around the fetus. External cephalic version has an average success rate of 58%. Version is most likely to succeed when: The mother has already had at least one pregnancy and childbirth. The fetus, or a foot or leg, has not dropped down into the pelvis (has not engaged). The fetus is surrounded by a normal amount of amniotic fluid. The procedure is done near term (36 or more completed weeks of pregnancy), before labor starts. Version is least likely to succeed when: Compared to the first attempt, repeat version attempts are less likely to be successful. With frequent monitoring, the risks of external cephalic version to the mother and fetus are low. Potential risks of version, for which the fetus and mother are closely monitored, include: Twisting or squeezing of the , reducing blood flow and oxygen to the fetus. The beginning of labor, which can be caused by rupture of the amniotic sac around the fetus (premature rupture of the membranes, or PROM). Placenta abruptio, rupture of the uterus, or damage to the umbilical cord. The potential exists for such complications, but they are very rare. In the rare case that labor begins or the fetus or mother develops a serious problem during version, an emergency cesarean section (C-section) may be done to deliver the fetus. Version has a very small risk for causing bleeding that could lead to mixing of the blood of the mother and fetus. So a pregnant woman with is given an Rh immunoglobulin injection (such as RhoGAM) to prevent Rh sensitization, which can cause fetal complications in future pregnancies. In rare cases, internal version is used to deliver a second twin or is used during labor when an emergency threatens the life of the fetus. In such a case, a doctor tries to turn the fetus by reaching into the uterus. Klatt TE, Cruikshank DP (2008). Breech, other malpresentations, and umbilical cord complications.

f760a6dc-842b-4850-a4f7-85a68b302ffa,"Many women with can have safe, successful pregnancies if they plan in advance with their healthcare teams. This article discusses the different pregnancy risk factors every woman who has lupus should understand, as well as the appropriate steps for modifying her disease management when she wants to have a baby. If I have lupus, is it safe for me to get pregnant? What are my risks if I have lupus and get pregnant? Which lupus medications are safe during pregnancy? Which lupus medications are safe for breastfeeding? If I have lupus, is it safe for me to get pregnant? In years past, women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE or “lupus”) were often advised by their rheumatologists and obstetricians to avoid pregnancy due to concern that pregnancy would trigger life-threatening lupus flares. Today, we know that most women with lupus can have successful pregnancies with far less risk. Ideally, pregnancies in patients with lupus are planned in advance and are managed by both an obstetrician (often a high-risk specialist) and a rheumatologist to optimize outcomes. What are my risks if I have lupus and get pregnant? Even with improvements in management over the years, the risks of pregnancy-related complications are still increased for lupus pregnancies when compared to the general population. However, recent clinical research has helped rheumatologists to identify patients who may have the highest risk of complications. Complications affecting pregnancies in women with lupus can include: Small-for-gestational age (SGA) infants (low-birth weight babies) Lupus disease flares that may damage the mother’s organs or (very rarely) be life-threatening Higher-than-average risks of other pregnancy associated conditions, such as: Gestational hypertension (high blood pressure during pregnancy) Preeclampsia – A condition that affects some women during pregnancy, this can involve gestational hypertension and other blood disorders, high protein in the urine and, in some cases, kidney and liver damage or dysfunction Eclampsia – Seizures caused by the damage to the body described in preeclampsia above, this condition can lead to organ failure and other life-threatening complications What lupus-related factors affect the risk of pregnancy complications? The likelihood of problems for both mother and infant depends in part on the degree of the woman’s lupus activity before and during her pregnancy. Pregnancy should be avoided if a woman: Experiences severe organ damage, such as kidney failure or insufficiency Requires medications to control her lupus which can increase risk of birth defects For this reason, rheumatologists encourage lupus patients to think ahead and discuss family planning with their physicians, so that these known risk factors can be addressed and modified whenever possible. Although severe disease-related organ damage is very rare, when it occurs, becoming pregnant may be dangerous or harmful to either the mother, the child or both. Pregnancy is a very high risk for any woman who has a severe case of kidney or other organ damage due to lupus. However, patients who undergo successful kidney transplantation after kidney failure can proceed with pregnancy (usually about one year after the transplant). In some circumstances, a patient with serious organ damage may still be able to safely undergo in vitro fertilization and have a surrogate mother carry the pregnancy, in order to have her own biological child. Others may choose to adopt. Patients with a history of kidney inflammation due to lupus (lupus nephritis) – even if they currently have normal kidney function – are at a higher risk for pregnancy complications than those lupus patients who have not ever had lupus nephritis. The risk of the pregnancy-associated complications preeclampsia and eclampsia may be as high as 25% for lupus patients, versus 5% in the general population. Follow up visits during the pregnancy will include frequent monitoring of blood pressure and urine protein. Formerly called toxemia, preeclampsia is a condition that develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy and reflects placental insufficiency. (Sometimes also called “uteroplacental vascular insufficiency,” this is when the placenta cannot provide enough nutrients and oxygen to the fetus to support growth.) Symptoms of preeclampsia usually include: New onset hypertension (sudden high blood pressure with no previous history of the same) Eclampsia, the most severe form of preeclampsia, is much rarer and can lead to seizures or stroke Distinguishing preeclampsia from a recurrence of active lupus nephritis is challenging, because both affect the kidneys and can cause similar symptoms. Since preeclampsia occurs only after 20 weeks gestation, kidney problems that occur prior to 20 weeks are likely due to SLE. A flare of lupus nephritis is more likely if other clinical symptoms of lupus are also present, such as rash or arthritis, as well as if changes in certain lupus-specific laboratory tests develop, such as . It is important to differentiate between preeclampsia and lupus nephritis whenever possible, because preeclampsia resolves only after delivery of the baby ends the pregnancy term, whereas active lupus must be managed with medical therapy. Although pregnancy is possible at some point for most lupus patients, optimal pregnancy timing depends in part on the level of lupus disease activity in the months prior to pregnancy. Pregnancy almost always has a better outcome for both mother and child when lupus has been quiet or stable for about six months prior to conception. When a patient’s lupus is very active, it is better to wait and get the disease under control before considering pregnancy. Patients with active disease during the six months prior to conception are at the highest risk for a lupus flare during pregnancy, with rates estimated as high as 60%. Lupus pregnancy outcomes may also vary with race and ethnicity. Black and Hispanic women with lupus have poorer pregnancy outcomes, even when adjusting for other known risk factors, such as high blood pressure, kidney disease, etc. In addition, first births may be associated with a slight increased risk of flare when compared with subsequent pregnancies. In a recent report from the PROMISSE study (Predictors of pRegnancy Outcome: bioMarkers In and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), the risk factors present at the start of pregnancy that were associated with pregnancy complications included: Presence of lupus anticoagulant (LAC), a type of The patient’s preexisting need to take medication for high blood pressure before pregnancy Doctors still do not all agree on the precise risk of the development of a lupus flare as a direct result of becoming pregnant. The PROMISSE study findings suggest that the rate of flare during pregnancy in women with stable lupus and normal kidney function at the time of conception is low. The rate of a severe lupus flare (one that requires hospitalization or a major change in medication) was 3% in the second trimester and 3% in the third trimester. The rate of a mild or moderate flare was less than 15%. The presence of certain autoantibodies can be important in predicting risk and in guiding monitoring and therapy. The presence of antiphospholipid antibodies is associated with an for early and late pregnancy loss (miscarriage), premature delivery, and SGA infants. These antibodies also appear to increase the risk of developing preeclampsia/eclampsia, including a severe variant called HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver function tests and Low Platelets). Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are found in about one-third of patients with lupus, and include three types of aPL: For patients with a history of typical aPL complications, prophylactic (preventative) therapy is used in subsequent pregnancies. Obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome (OB APS) is the term used to describe situations where aPL antibodies are moderate to high positive and certain obstetric complications are noted. These include: Early pregnancy losses (three or more consecutive losses at less than 10 weeks gestation) Late pregnancy losses (one or more losses at 10 or greater weeks gestation) Early delivery (at or prior to 34 weeks gestation) due to development of preeclampsia, intrauterine growth delay, or fetal distress While moderate or high titers of any of the three aPL antibodies may increase risk, LAC is most strongly associated with risk of pregnancy complications. The degree of risk associated with lower level aPL is uncertain but appears to be lower than the risk with moderate to high titer antibodies. Infants of mothers with anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies are at risk for a condition called “neonatal lupus erythematosus” (NLE). Approximately one-third of SLE patients and a majority of patients have anti-Ro/SS-A and/or anti-La/SS-B antibodies. NLE is not true lupus, but rather the result of inflammation in the developing fetus due to the passage of these antibodies through the placenta. The risk of inflammation in the infant is about 15% to 20%, and usually this inflammation is reversible. When it is present it can cause temporary low platelet count, an irritated liver or rash. The presence of these antibodies generates a 2% risk that the baby will develop complete congenital heart block. This is an irreversible damage to the heart that usually requires placement of a pacemaker in the infant. Very rarely, generalized inflammation of the heart may occur and lead to stillbirth or death of the infant soon after birth. Risk factor: Medications to control lupus or other rheumatic disease, which can increase the risk of birth defects When planning pregnancy, it is important to be aware of which lupus medications should not be taken several months before or during the pregnancy, due to their known risk of causing birth defects. These include: Patients on these medications are usually tapered off (if possible) or switched to medications that are considered compatible with pregnancy. They are then monitored by their doctor for some months to assure that the new medications are tolerated and effective before a pregnancy is attempted. One of the most effective ways to optimize the outcome of a pregnancy in lupus patients is to plan ahead and assure that disease is well-controlled using medications that are safe for pregnancy. Schedule regular rheumatology appointments for monitoring In general, lupus patients should be seen by a rheumatologist a minimum of once a trimester, with labs checked during those visits. More frequent visits are warranted if there are any complicating issues, and the obstetrician will have separately scheduled follow-up appointments. As noted above, patients should have their medications reviewed and altered prior to pregnancy if necessary. Patients should have aPL and anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies checked prior to or early in a pregnancy. These test results help to define monitoring and possible therapy. Patients with positive aPL without a history of related obstetric complications are generally treated with low-dose aspirin during pregnancy for potential preeclampsia prevention. The combination of low-dose aspirin (81 mg daily) and injections of a low dose of heparin (most commonly a daily, 40 mg subcutaneous injection of the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin) is the standard prophylactic therapy for aPL-positive patients with typical obstetric complications (OB APS) and has been shown to reduce risk of subsequent pregnancy complications or loss. For patients with a history of blood clots who are on warfarin, warfarin should be discontinued and replaced with a therapeutic dosage of enoxaparin before or at the onset of pregnancy. During the third trimester, patients are generally monitored with a weekly series of ultrasound tests, as well as nonstress testing (or other fetal monitoring). Aspirin or anticoagulation medication is generally continued for 6 to 12 weeks postpartum to minimize risk of postpartum blood clots. Monitor the fetus in patients with positive anti-Ro/SS-A and/or La/SS-B antibodies Because anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies are associated with risk of complete congenital heart block in the fetus or newborn, monitoring with fetal echocardiograms during part of the pregnancy is recommended. Antibody-positive women are generally advised to have a series of screenings using fetal echocardiograms between weeks 16 and 26 to monitor the development of the fetal heart conduction system (although the best timing interval for these tests is not known). Because the risk of heart block is 15% to 20% in children of a mother with a previously affected child, many experts recommend that women with such a history have weekly fetal echocardiograms during that period. Most experts treat incomplete heart block (defined as first- or second-degree heart block) with the steroid dexamethasone (4 mg daily) with the hope of preventing progression. Dexamethasone is a fluorinated steroid, and unlike prednisone, it passes through the placenta largely intact so that it may suppress the autoantibody-induced inflammation in the fetus. Complete heart block in utero has not been shown to be reversible with any therapy, however, and is generally not treated medicinally unless associated with other inflammatory changes in the heart tissue. Instead, a complete heart block in the newborn usually requires a permanent pacemaker. Preliminary research suggests that being on hydroxychloroquine throughout pregnancy may protect somewhat against the development of heart block. Although it is not yet clear what benefit may be expected, patients with a history of neonatal lupus erythematosus in prior children are generally treated with hydroxychloroquine if they are not already taking the drug and there is no contraindication. While it is not known whether antibody-positive patients without a history of NLE will benefit, many patients with positive serologies are also treated because of the low risk associated with this medication. Which lupus medications are safe during pregnancy? As discussed in the risk factors section above, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide be taken several months before or during the pregnancy.* Common medications for lupus that are safe for pregnant women include: Several studies suggest that taking NSAIDs while trying to conceive can negatively affect ovulation and implantation, but the clinical significance of these possible effects is not clear. NSAIDs must be discontinued in the third trimester, however, due to the risk of premature closure of the ductus arteriosus (a primary blood vessel of the heart) in the fetus, which can lead to progressive fetal heart failure). Most experts also suggest low-dose aspirin during pregnancy for all patients with lupus, as this may decrease the risk of developing preeclampsia. The commonly used (nonfluorinated) steroids prednisone and prednisolone are routinely utilized to manage active lupus during pregnancy. In contrast to fluorinated glucocorticoids, these medications cross the placenta in low concentrations due to inactivation by placental enzymes. While early reports suggested an increased risk of cleft lip/palate formation with steroid use during pregnancy, more recent studies have not shown this. However, the use of steroids throughout pregnancy may increase the risk of: Pregnancy-induced hypertension (high blood pressure) For these reasons, the goal of treatment is to use the lowest dose for the shortest amount of time. Hydroxychloroquine is an essential component of the management of SLE. Patients with SLE have been shown to have better pregnancy outcomes if they remain on this drug, which does not increase risk of congenital anomalies. Retinal exams of infants exposed to hydroxychloroquine in utero do not show evidence of toxicity. Disease flares are generally managed with prednisone or prednisolone, but if necessary, stronger, immunosuppressive agents safe for pregnancy, such as azathioprine, are used. Azathioprine is commonly used in the management of transplant patients, inflammatory bowel disease patients, and patients with lupus and other rheumatic diseases throughout pregnancy. Published data do not show any increased risk of birth defects in infants exposed to these medications in utero. Similarly, cyclosporine and tacrolimus, studied primarily in pregnant transplant patients, do not appear to increase the risk of birth defects and are alternatives for patients who are unable to tolerate or do not respond to azathioprine. There are limited data regarding use of these relatively new biologic medications during pregnancy. However, because they are modeled on the structure of immunoglobulin G (IgG) proteins, it is expected that very little of either medication is transferred to the fetus until after 12 weeks of gestation, when placental transfer of IgG begins. Because of this delay in transfer to the fetus, it is reasonable to consider continuation of these agents, if necessary, right up until a pregnancy is confirmed. Routine use of these medications throughout pregnancy is discouraged based on the limited number of reports, but rituximab may be considered for use during pregnancy for severe organ or life-threatening disease. Which lupus medications are safe for breastfeeding? Several of the above-mentioned therapies are safe for women who are breastfeeding, with some exceptions and variations. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life and continued breastfeeding for another six months. The short-term benefits of breast-feeding include better nutrition and improved immunity in the infant. Below are helpful guidelines for lupus medication use by women who are breastfeeding: NSAIDs cross into breast milk in low concentrations and are compatible with nursing. Ibuprofen is generally recommended, since this has the most information. Nonfluorinated forms such as prednisone and prednisolone are compatible with nursing, since they enter breast milk in low concentrations. With prednisone, at doses greater than 20 mg daily, women are encouraged to either refrain from breastfeeding or pump and discard breast milk for the first four hours after taking the medication to minimize the amount transferred to the infant. Very little hydroxychloroquine is transferred into breast milk, and it is considered compatible with breastfeeding. Breastfed infants whose mothers were taking hydroxychloroquine have not shown retinal or other abnormalities. Azathioprine is rapidly metabolized (during which it converts to 6-mercaptopurine) and appears in breast milk in very low concentrations; it is considered compatible with nursing. Cyclosporine appears to have more variable transfer although it too is considered compatible, as is tacrolimus. Mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate and cyclophosphamide are not recommended for use in lactating women. There are limited data on these biologic drugs during lactation, however very little IgG is transferred into breast milk and so these are likely safe for breastfeeding. Successful pregnancies have become the rule, rather than the exception, for women with lupus. In years past, the fear of serious illness or death prevented many women with lupus from pursuing pregnancy. Things have changed: in a recently published analysis of a large national pregnancy database, Bella Mehta, MD, and her coauthors found that rates of pregnancy-related maternal death in patients with lupus decreased dramatically over the last 10 to 15 years. While the overall numbers are very low, the relative risk of women with lupus dying in the setting of pregnancy has dropped from 100 times to 2.5 times the current risk expected in the general population. Other pregnancy complications, though still increased in women with lupus, have improved as well. Pregnancy outcome is optimized if pregnancy is planned for times of stable or quiet disease and while on pregnancy compatible medications. Open communication between patients and their physicians is critical. Both the rheumatologist and the obstetrician should follow the patient, working together with the patient as a team. Continued research and education should lead to even better outcomes in the years to come. Most patients with lupus can have successful pregnancies. Planning for pregnancy can reduce the risk of pregnancy complications. Important risk factors for pregnancy complications include active lupus, history of nephritis, and presence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Patients with a history of aPL pregnancy complications should be treated with low-dose aspirin and enoxaparin (or other heparin) during pregnancy. Patients with positive anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies are at risk to have a child with neonatal lupus erythematosus, including a 2% risk of complete heart block, and should be monitored with serial fetal echocardiograms from week 16 to week 26. Lupus medications considered compatible with pregnancy include hydroxychloroquine, prednisone and prednisolone, azathioprine, cyclosporine and tacrolimus. Medications that should not be used during pregnancy include mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide. Other medications have inadequate data for use in pregnancy. Organization of Teratology Information Specialists (OTIS) Includes printable patient fact sheets for common meds *For many years, physicians relied on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) system of assigning a category of risk (A-B-C-D or X) to guide use of any medication during pregnancy. While the categories were developed to reflect the quality and type of information available (animal vs. human clinical research), the letter grade was often incorrectly assumed to imply only risk of birth defects. The FDA is in the process of changing medication labeling to include more clinically relevant data. Sammaritano LR. Management of systemic lupus erythematous during pregnancy.

Two babies are twins and three are triplets. Multiple pregnancies are becoming more common as more women are using fertility treatments and getting pregnant at an older age. You are at a higher risk of complications like premature birth, preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction with a multiple pregnancy. A multiple pregnancy is a pregnancy where you’re carrying more than one baby at a time. If you’re carrying two babies, they are called twins. Three babies that are carried during one pregnancy are called triplets. You can also carry more than three babies at one time (high-order multiples). There are typically more risks linked to a multiple pregnancy than a singleton (carrying only one baby) pregnancy. There are two main ways that a multiple pregnancy can happen: One fertilized egg (ovum) splits before it implants in the uterine lining. Two or more separate eggs are fertilized by different sperm at the same time. These two different types of multiple pregnancy result in either identical or fraternal siblings. The difference between identical and fraternal babies goes back to how the multiple pregnancy happens. Identical twins or triplets happen when a single egg is fertilized and then later splits. These newly divided embryos are identical. Children that are identical multiples will look like each other and be the same sex. Fraternal multiples develop from separate eggs that are fertilized by a different sperm. Because these are different eggs and different sperm, the genetic material is varied. These children won’t look identical and can be different sexes from each other. In a pregnancy with triplets or more, your babies could be all identical, all fraternal or a mixture of both. This can happen if your body releases multiple eggs and more than one is fertilized. In a case where you have both identical and fraternal multiples, more than one egg was fertilized and then at least one of those eggs also split after fertilization. Are identical twins or triplets always the same sex? Because identical twins or triplets share genetic material, they are always the same sex. The sex of a baby is determined by the particular sperm cell that fertilizes the egg at conception. There are two kinds of sperm cells — those carrying an X chromosome or Y chromosome. The mother’s egg carries an X chromosome. If a sperm cell carrying an X chromosome fertilizes the egg, it will make a XX combination (female). If the sperm cell is carrying a Y chromosome, you end up with an XY pairing (male). Identical multiples start as one egg and then split, so whatever chromosome combination is present at fertilization is the sex of all multiples. What increases the chance of a multiple pregnancy? There are several factors that can increase the risk of a multiple birth. You might be at a higher risk of getting pregnant with more than one baby at a time if you: Are older (women in their 30s are at a higher risk of multiples because the body starts to release multiple eggs at one time when you get older). You might also be at a higher risk of a multiple pregnancy if you are taller than average or have a higher body weight. Another risk factor for a multiple pregnancy is genetic. There is an increased possibility of a multiple pregnancy if you are a multiple yourself, or if multiples run in your family. This heredity trait is generally passed down through the maternal (mother’s) side of the family. The use of fertility drugs can be another reason you might have a multiple birth. Treatments for infertility can increase your risk of a multiple pregnancy because procedures, like in vitro fertilization (IVF), often involve transferring more than one fertilized egg into your womb. Your provider usually transfers more than one egg at a time to increase the odds of a successful pregnancy. Multiple births have become more common in recent years because more people are using fertility drugs and procedures, such as IVF, to help conceive a baby. The only way to know if you’re pregnant with more than one baby during your pregnancy is through an ultrasound exam with your healthcare provider. During this test, your provider can look at images of the inside of your uterus and confirm how many babies are in there. You might experience more intense symptoms during a multiple pregnancy than with a single pregnancy. These can include: Rapid weight gain in the first trimester of pregnancy. High human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) levels — this hormone is made during pregnancy and is what a pregnancy test picks up. High amounts of the protein alpha-fetoprotein in your blood. Apart from an ultrasound, your provider might suspect multiples if there’s more than one heartbeat detected during a fetal Doppler scan. Anyone can experience complications during pregnancy — regardless of how many babies you’re carrying. However, most healthcare providers consider multiple pregnancies higher risk than single pregnancies. This doesn’t mean that every woman who carries more than one baby during a pregnancy is going to have problems. If you’re pregnant with multiples, your provider will want to watch you for possible complications that can happen when you carry more than one baby at once. Your provider will talk to you about each risk factor and frequently check with you to make sure you aren’t experiencing anything concerning. : The most common complication of multiple births is premature labor. If you’re pregnant for multiples, you are more likely to go into premature labor (before 37 weeks) than a woman carrying only one baby. The goal for many moms of multiples is to complete 37 weeks. This is considered term in a twin pregnancy and reaching this week of gestation increases the chance the babies will be born healthy and at a good weight. Babies that are born prematurely are at risk of another complication of multiple births — low birth weight. : High blood pressure is called hypertension. During pregnancy, your healthcare provider will watch your blood pressure carefully to make sure you don’t develop gestational hypertension (high blood pressure during pregnancy). This can lead to a dangerous condition called preeclampsia. Complications related to high blood pressure happen at twice the rate in women carrying multiples compared to women pregnant with only one baby. This complication also tends to happen earlier in pregnancy and be more severe in multiple pregnancies than single pregnancies. : You can develop diabetes during pregnancy. This happens because of the increased amount of hormones from the placenta. The size of the placenta can also be a factor in this condition. If you have two placentas, there’s an increased resistance to insulin. : This condition happens when the placenta detaches (separates) from the wall of your uterus before delivery. This is an emergency situation. Placenta abruption is more common in women who are carrying multiples. : This condition can also be called intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or small for gestational age (SGA). This condition happens when one or more of your babies is not growing at the proper rate. This condition might cause the babies to be born prematurely or at a low birth-weight. Nearly half of pregnancies with more than one baby have this problem. Fraternal twins always have two placentas. The risks of pregnancies with fraternal twins are similar to those of pregnancies with only one baby. However, the number of possible risks are increased when compared to pregnancies with one baby. Identical twins may have one placenta (70% of the cases) or two placentas (30% of the cases). The risks of identical twins with two placentas are similar to those listed above for fraternal twins. Identical twins with one placenta (called monochorionic) have risks that are unique to them. In 5 to 15% of the cases, they may develop a condition called twin-twin-transfusion-syndrome (TTTS). This is the consequence of vascular communications at the placenta level between the twins. Due to these communications, the twins may share their blood. When this happens — if nothing is done — there is a 90% risk that the twins will die in-utero. In-utero procedures are performed to decrease the fetal death risk for the twins. Another complication that can happen in identical twins with one placenta is called twin-anemia-polycythemia sequence (TAPS). This is due to blood that goes from one twin to the co-twin because of vascular communications at the placental level. In this condition, one twin becomes anemic (low red-blood cells), whereas the co-twin becomes polycythemic (too many red-blood cells). Several treatments/interventions are performed when this happens. A third condition that can occur in identical twins with one placenta is called” selective IUGR”. One twin grows well, whereas the co-twin does not experience much growth. Another condition typical of identical twins is called twin-reversed-arterial-perfusion syndrome. In this condition, the heart of one twin pumps blood for the circulation of both twins. One twin does not have the heart and will not survive following birth. The outcome of the twin with the normal heart varies. Fortunately, this syndrome is rare (1 in 20,000 to 40,000) and it is amenable to in-utero procedures. Identical twins with one placenta may also be in the same sac. They are called monochorionic (one placenta)-monoamniotic (one gestational sac). This pregnancy occurs in 1% of multiple gestations and it’s associated with an increased risk for one or both twins. Your healthcare provider will diagnose the above conditions with an ultrasound. Am I more likely to have a C-section delivery if I’m carrying multiples? A cesarean section is a procedure used to deliver a baby through an incision (cut) in the abdomen. This type of delivery might be used for a variety of reasons, but it’s fairly common in multiple births. Your chance of having a C-section for a multiple birth is higher than if you were pregnant for only one baby. However, even in single births, a C-section can sometimes be the safest option for delivery. Often, the babies aren’t in the right position for birth — head down. A C-section can also happen if you have a complication during pregnancy that means a vaginal birth isn’t the safest option for you or your babies. Your healthcare provider will monitor you leading up to your due date and talk to you about the best option for delivery. What can I do to stay healthy during a multiple pregnancy? , , and visiting the doctor regularly are important steps for any pregnant woman to take toward a healthy pregnancy. These steps are especially important during multiple pregnancies. If you’re expecting multiples, you have additional dietary needs to meet. Getting enough protein and enough (fluids) is important. You’ll also need to make sure you get enough extra calories for the developing fetuses. One rule of thumb is to eat an extra 300 calories a day per baby. That means that if you’re pregnant with twins, you will need to add 600 calories to your daily diet. Talk to your healthcare provider about your diet and the specific amounts you’ll need for a healthy pregnancy. Moms of multiples might also experience the typical discomforts of pregnancy more intensely. It’s important to take good care of yourself and get plenty of rest to help ease the stresses of pregnancy. In some cases, you might want to find a healthcare provider who has experience with multiple births. Specialized healthcare can help ensure that you and your babies are receiving the best care available. The need for frequent, intensive is very important in a multiple pregnancy. Talk to your family doctor or OBGYN about their recommendations for specialists. Can I be active and exercise during a multiple pregnancy? Exercise and activity is an important part of any pregnancy. In most cases, you can absolutely exercise during a multiple pregnancy. Low-impact exercises are a great way to stay in shape and maintain your health throughout pregnancy. Some low-impact exercises to try during a multiple pregnancy can include: Even though activity is wonderful during pregnancy, you should talk to your healthcare provider about the best activities for you. Some more strenuous activities might not be a good idea during a multiple pregnancy, including: It’s also important to remember that your exercise routine might need to change over time if you experience any complications.

This pregnancy occurs in 1% of multiple gestations and it’s associated with an increased risk for one or both twins. Your healthcare provider will diagnose the above conditions with an ultrasound. Am I more likely to have a C-section delivery if I’m carrying multiples? A cesarean section is a procedure used to deliver a baby through an incision (cut) in the abdomen. This type of delivery might be used for a variety of reasons, but it’s fairly common in multiple births. Your chance of having a C-section for a multiple birth is higher than if you were pregnant for only one baby. However, even in single births, a C-section can sometimes be the safest option for delivery. Often, the babies aren’t in the right position for birth — head down. A C-section can also happen if you have a complication during pregnancy that means a vaginal birth isn’t the safest option for you or your babies. Your healthcare provider will monitor you leading up to your due date and talk to you about the best option for delivery. What can I do to stay healthy during a multiple pregnancy? , , and visiting the doctor regularly are important steps for any pregnant woman to take toward a healthy pregnancy. These steps are especially important during multiple pregnancies. If you’re expecting multiples, you have additional dietary needs to meet. Getting enough protein and enough (fluids) is important. You’ll also need to make sure you get enough extra calories for the developing fetuses. One rule of thumb is to eat an extra 300 calories a day per baby. That means that if you’re pregnant with twins, you will need to add 600 calories to your daily diet. Talk to your healthcare provider about your diet and the specific amounts you’ll need for a healthy pregnancy. Moms of multiples might also experience the typical discomforts of pregnancy more intensely. It’s important to take good care of yourself and get plenty of rest to help ease the stresses of pregnancy. In some cases, you might want to find a healthcare provider who has experience with multiple births. Specialized healthcare can help ensure that you and your babies are receiving the best care available. The need for frequent, intensive is very important in a multiple pregnancy. Talk to your family doctor or OBGYN about their recommendations for specialists. Can I be active and exercise during a multiple pregnancy? Exercise and activity is an important part of any pregnancy. In most cases, you can absolutely exercise during a multiple pregnancy. Low-impact exercises are a great way to stay in shape and maintain your health throughout pregnancy. Some low-impact exercises to try during a multiple pregnancy can include: Even though activity is wonderful during pregnancy, you should talk to your healthcare provider about the best activities for you. Some more strenuous activities might not be a good idea during a multiple pregnancy, including: It’s also important to remember that your exercise routine might need to change over time if you experience any complications.

About 15 million were born , while between 3 and 12 percent were born . In the most deliveries occur in hospitals, while in the most births take place at home with the support of a . The most common way of childbirth is a . It involves three stages of labour: the and during the first stage, descent and birth of the baby during the second stage, and the delivery of the during the third stage. The first stage begins with crampy abdominal or back pain that lasts around half a minute and occurs every 10 to 30 minutes. The pain becomes stronger and closer together over time. The second stage ends when the infant is fully expelled. In the third stage, the delivery of the placenta, is generally recommended. As of 2014, all major health organizations advise that immediately following vaginal birth, or as soon as the mother is alert and responsive after a Caesarean section, that the infant be placed on the mother's chest, termed contact, delaying routine procedures for at least one to two hours or until the baby has had its first breastfeeding. Most babies are born ; however about 4% are born feet or buttocks first, known as . Typically the head enters the pelvis facing to one side, and then rotates to face down. During labour, a woman can generally eat and move around as she likes. A number of methods can help with pain, such as , , and . While making a cut to the opening of the vagina, known as an , is common, it is generally not needed. In 2012, about 23 million deliveries occurred by Caesarean section, an operation on the abdomen. Each year, complications from pregnancy and childbirth result in about 500,000 , seven million women have serious long-term problems, and 50 million women have negative health outcomes following delivery. Most of these occur in the . Specific complications include , , , and . Complications in the baby may include , , , and infections. A showing a woman giving birth between two , ornamented with . From Iran, 1000 to 650 BC, at the . The most prominent sign of labour is strong repetitive . The distress levels reported by labouring women vary widely. They appear to be influenced by fear and anxiety levels, experience with prior childbirth, cultural ideas of childbirth pain, mobility during labour, and the support received during labour. Personal expectations, the amount of support from caregivers, quality of the caregiver-patient relationship, and involvement in decision-making are more important in women's overall satisfaction with the experience of childbirth than are other factors such as age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, preparation, physical environment, pain, immobility, or medical interventions. Pain in contractions has been described as feeling similar to very strong menstrual cramps. Women are often encouraged to refrain from screaming. However, moaning and grunting may be encouraged to help lessen pain. Crowning may be experienced as an intense stretching and burning. Even women who show little reaction to labour pains, in comparison to other women, show a substantially severe reaction to crowning (the appearance of the baby's head). is a term for specific pain occurring in the lower back, just above the , during childbirth. During the later stages of gestation there is an increase in abundance of , a hormone that is known to evoke feelings of contentment, reductions in anxiety, and feelings of calmness and security around the mate. Oxytocin is further released during labour when the fetus stimulates the cervix and vagina, and it is believed that it plays a major role in the bonding of a mother to her infant and in the establishment of maternal behavior. The act of nursing a child also causes a release of oxytocin. Between 70% and 80% of mothers in the United States report some feelings of sadness or ""baby blues"" after giving birth. The symptoms normally occur for a few minutes up to few hours each day and they should lessen and disappear within two weeks after delivery. may develop in some women. Preventive group therapy has proven effective as a prophylactic treatment for postpartum depression. Sequence of images showing the stages of ordinary childbirth. Humans are bipedal with an erect stance. The erect posture causes the weight of the abdominal contents to thrust on the , a complex structure which must not only support this weight but allow, in women, three channels to pass through it: the , the and the . The infant's head and shoulders must go through a specific sequence of maneuvers in order to pass through the ring of the mother's pelvis. Six phases of a typical vertex or (head-first presentation) delivery: of the in the transverse position. The baby's head is facing across the pelvis at one or other of the mother's hips. . The fetal head rotates 90 degrees to the so that the baby's face is towards the mother's rectum. . The fetal head is bowed, chin on chest, so that the back or crown of its head leads the way through the birth canal, until the back of its neck presses against the pubic bone and its chin leaves its chest, extending the neck—as if to look up, and the rest of its head passes out of the birth canal. . The fetal head turns through 45 degrees to restore its normal relationship with the shoulders, which are still at an angle. . The shoulders repeat the corkscrew movements of the head, which can be seen in the final movements of the fetal head. The vagina is called a 'birth canal' when the baby enters this passage. refers to the relationship of the fetal presenting part to the level of the ischial spines. When the presenting part is at the ischial spines the station is 0 (synonymous with engagement). If the presenting fetal part is above the spines, the distance is measured and described as minus stations, which range from −1 to −4 cm. If the presenting part is below the ischial spines, the distance is stated as plus stations ( +1 to +4 cm). At +3 and +4 the presenting part is at the perineum and can be seen. The fetal head may temporarily change shape substantially (becoming more elongated) as it moves through the birth canal. This change in the shape of the fetal head is called and is much more prominent in women having their first vaginal delivery. is the physical and chemical changes in the cervix to prepare it for the stretching that will take place as the fetus moves out of the uterus and into the birth canal. A scoring system called a can be used to judge the degree of cervical ripening in order to predict the timing of labor and delivery of the infant or for women at risk for preterm labor. It is also used to judge when a woman will respond to for a postdate pregnancy or other medical reasons. There are several methods of inducing cervical ripening which will allow the uterine contractions to effectively dilate the cervix. There are various definitions of the onset of labour, including: Regular uterine contractions at least every six minutes with evidence of change in or between consecutive digital examinations. Regular contractions occurring less than 10 minutes apart and progressive cervical dilation or cervical effacement. At least three painful regular uterine contractions during a 10-minute period, each lasting more than 45 seconds. In order to avail for more uniform terminology, the first stage of labour is divided into ""latent"" and ""active"" phases, where the latent phase is sometimes included in the definition of labour, and sometimes not. Common signs that labour, commonly spelled as labor, is about to begin may include ""lightening"". Lightening is the process of the baby moving down from the rib cage with the head of the baby engaging deep in the pelvis. The pregnant woman may then find breathing easier, since her lungs have more room for expansion, but pressure on her bladder may cause more frequent need to void (urinate). Lightening may occur a few weeks or a few hours before labour begins, or even not until labour has begun. Some women also experience an increase in vaginal discharge several days before labour begins when the ""mucus plug"", a thick plug of that blocks the opening to the uterus, is pushed out into the vagina. The mucus plug may become dislodged days before labour begins or not until the start of labour. While inside the uterus the baby is enclosed in a fluid-filled membrane called the . Shortly before, at the beginning of, or during labour the sac ruptures. Once the sac ruptures, termed ""the water breaks"", the baby is at risk for infection and the mother's medical team will assess the need to if it has not started within the time they believe to be safe for the infant. Many women are known to experience what has been termed the ""nesting instinct"". Women report a spurt of energy shortly before going into labour. Folklore has long held that most babies are born in the late night or very early morning and recent (2018) research has found this to be correct in the US, but only for babies born at home or on Saturday or Sunday. All other births are most likely to occur between 8 a.m. and noon, a reflection of the fact that planned C-sections are generally scheduled for 8 a.m. Likewise, births from induced deliveries rose during the morning hours and peaked at 3 p.m. The most likely day of the week for a baby's birthday in the US is Monday, followed by Tuesday, likely related to scheduled deliveries as well. The latent phase is generally defined as beginning at the point at which the woman perceives regular . In contrast, , which are contractions that may start around 26 weeks gestation and are sometimes called ""false labour"", are infrequent, irregular, and involve only mild cramping. , which is the thinning and stretching of the , and occur during the closing weeks of . Effacement is usually complete or near-complete and dilation is about 5 cm by the end of the latent phase. The degree of cervical effacement and dilation may be felt during a vaginal examination. The latent phase ends with the onset of the active first stage. The active stage of labour (or ""active phase of first stage"" if the previous phase is termed ""latent phase of first stage"") has geographically differing definitions. The World Health Organization describes the active first stage as ""a period of time characterized by regular painful uterine contractions, a substantial degree of cervical effacement and more rapid cervical dilatation from 5 cm until full dilatation for first and subsequent labours. In the US, the definition of active labour was changed from 3 to 4 cm, to 5 cm of for multiparous women, mothers who had given birth previously, and at 6 cm for nulliparous women, those who had not given birth before. This was done in an effort to increase the rates of vaginal delivery. Health care providers may assess a labouring mother's progress in labour by performing a cervical exam to evaluate the cervical dilation, effacement, and station. These factors form the . The Bishop score can also be used as a means to predict the success of an . During effacement, the cervix becomes incorporated into the lower segment of the uterus. During a contraction, uterine muscles contract causing shortening of the upper segment and drawing upwards of the lower segment, in a gradual expulsive motion. The presenting fetal part then is permitted to descend. Full dilation is reached when the cervix has widened enough to allow passage of the baby's head, around 10 cm dilation for a term baby. A standard duration of the latent first stage has not been established and can vary widely from one woman to another. However, the duration of active first stage (from 5 cm until full cervical dilatation) usually does not extend beyond 12 hours in first labours (""primiparae""), and usually does not extend beyond 10 hours in subsequent labours (""multiparae""). , also called ""dysfunctional labor"" or ""failure to progress"", is difficult labor or abnormally slow progress of labor, involving progressive cervical dilatation or lack of descent of the fetus. Friedman's Curve, developed in 1955, was for many years used to determine labor dystocia. However, more recent medical research suggests that the Friedman curve may not be currently applicable. The expulsion stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated, and ends when the baby is born. As pressure on the cervix increases, a sensation of pelvic pressure is experienced, and, with it, an urge to begin pushing. At the beginning of the normal second stage, the head is fully engaged in the pelvis; the widest diameter of the head has passed below the level of the . The fetal head then continues descent into the pelvis, below the pubic arch and out through the vaginal (opening). This is assisted by the additional maternal efforts of ""bearing down"" or pushing, similar to . The appearance of the fetal head at the vaginal orifice is termed the ""crowning"". At this point, the mother will feel an intense burning or stinging sensation. When the has not ruptured during labour or pushing, the infant can be born with the membranes intact. This is referred to as ""delivery en "". Complete expulsion of the baby signals the successful completion of the second stage of labour. Some babies, especially preterm infants, are born covered with a waxy or cheese-like white substance called . It is thought to have some protective roles during fetal development and for a few hours after birth. The second stage varies from one woman to another. In first labours, birth is usually completed within three hours whereas in subsequent labours, birth is usually completed within two hours. Second-stage labours longer than three hours are associated with declining rates of spontaneous vaginal delivery and increasing rates of infection, , and obstetric hemorrhage, as well as the need for intensive care of the neonate. Further information: and The period from just after the fetus is expelled until just after the placenta is expelled is called the or the . begins as a physiological separation from the wall of the uterus. The average time from delivery of the baby until complete expulsion of the placenta is estimated to be 10–12 minutes dependent on whether active or expectant management is employed. In as many as 3% of all vaginal deliveries, the duration of the third stage is longer than 30 minutes and raises concern for . Placental expulsion can be managed actively or it can be managed expectantly, allowing the placenta to be expelled without medical assistance. Active management is the administration of a drug within one minute of fetal delivery, controlled traction of the umbilical cord and massage after delivery of the placenta, followed by performance of uterine massage every 15 minutes for two hours. In a joint statement, , the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics and the recommend active management of the third stage of labour in all vaginal deliveries to help to prevent . Delaying the clamping of the for at least one minute or until it ceases to pulsate, which may take several minutes, improves outcomes as long as there is the ability to treat if it occurs. For many years it was believed that late cord cutting led to a mother's risk of experiencing significant bleeding after giving birth, called . However a recent review found that delayed cord cutting in healthy full-term infants resulted in early concentration and higher birthweight and increased iron reserves up to six months after birth with no change in the rate of postpartum bleeding. Further information: and The ""fourth stage of labour"" is the period beginning immediately after the birth of a child and extending for about six weeks. The terms and are often used for this period. The woman's body, including hormone levels and uterus size, return to a non-pregnant state and the newborn adjusts to life outside the mother's body. The (WHO) describes the postnatal period as the most critical and yet the most neglected phase in the lives of mothers and babies; most deaths occur during the postnatal period. Following the birth, if the mother had an or a tearing of the , it is stitched. This is also an optimal time for uptake of (LARC), such as the or (IUD), both of which can be inserted immediately after delivery while the woman is still in the delivery room. The mother has regular assessments for uterine contraction and , vaginal bleeding, heart rate and blood pressure, and temperature, for the first 24 hours after birth. The first passing of urine should be documented within six hours. Afterpains (pains similar to menstrual cramps), contractions of the uterus to prevent excessive blood flow, continue for several days. Vaginal discharge, termed ""lochia"", can be expected to continue for several weeks; initially bright red, it gradually becomes pink, changing to brown, and finally to yellow or white. Some women experience an uncontrolled episode of shivering or , after the birth. Until recently babies born in hospitals were removed from their mothers shortly after birth and brought to the mother only at feeding times. Mothers were told that their newborn would be safer in the nursery and that the separation would offer the mother more time to rest. As attitudes began to change, some hospitals offered a ""rooming in"" option wherein after a period of routine hospital procedures and observation, the infant could be allowed to share the mother's room. As of 2020, rooming in has become standard practice. Around 2000 authorities began to question the practice of removing the newborn immediately postpartum for routine postnatal procedures before being returned to the mother. Some authorities began to suggest that early skin-to-skin contact (placing the naked baby on the mother's chest) may benefit both mother and infant. Using animal studies that showed that the intimate contact inherent in skin-to-skin contact promotes neurobehaviors that result in the fulfillment of basic biological needs as a model, studies were done to assess what, if any, advantages may be associated with early skin-to-skin contact for human mothers and their babies. A 2011 medical review looked at existing studies and found that early skin-to-skin contact, sometimes called , resulted in improved outcomes, cardio-respiratory stability, and a decrease in infant crying. A 2016 found that skin-to-skin contact at birth promotes the likelihood and effectiveness of breastfeeding. As of 2014, early postpartum skin-to-skin contact is endorsed by all major organizations that are responsible for the well-being of infants, including the . The (WHO) states that ""the process of childbirth is not finished until the baby has safely transferred from placental to mammary nutrition."" It is advised that the newborn be placed skin-to-skin with the mother following vaginal birth, or as soon as the mother is alert and responsive after a Caesarean section, postponing any routine procedures for at least one to two hours. The WHO suggests that any initial observations of the infant can be done while the infant remains close to the mother, saying that even a brief separation before the baby has had its first feed can disturb the bonding process. They further advise frequent skin-to-skin contact as much as possible during the first days after delivery, especially if it was interrupted for some reason after the delivery. Main articles: and In many cases and with increasing frequency, childbirth is achieved through or . Labor induction is the process or treatment that stimulates childbirth and delivery. Inducing labor can be accomplished with pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical methods. Inductions are most often performed either with drug treatment alone, or with a combination of prostaglandin and intravenous treatment.. Caesarean section is the removal of the through a surgical incision in the abdomen, rather than through vaginal birth. Childbirth by C-Sections increased 50% in the US from 1996 to 2006. In 2011, 32.8 percent of births in the US were delivered by cesarean section. Induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks can be harmful to the neonate as well as harmful or without benefit to the mother. Therefore, many guidelines recommend against non-medically required induced births and elective cesarean before 39 weeks. The 2012 rate of labour induction in the United States was 23.3 percent, and has more than doubled from 1990 to 2010. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines recommend a full evaluation of the maternal-fetal status, the status of the cervix, and at least a 39 completed weeks (full term) of gestation for optimal health of the newborn when considering elective induction of labour. Per these guidelines, the following conditions may be an indication for induction, including: Fetal compromise such as isoimmunization leading to or Maternal conditions such as or Induction is also considered for logistical reasons, such as the distance from hospital or psychosocial conditions, but in these instances gestational age confirmation must be done, and the maturity of the fetal lung must be confirmed by testing. The ACOG also note that contraindications for induced labour are the same as for spontaneous vaginal delivery, including , complete , or active infection. Share of births attended by skilled health staff. Deliveries are assisted by a number of professionals including: , and . For low risk pregnancies all three result in similar outcomes. Eating or drinking during labour is an area of ongoing debate. While some have argued that eating in labour has no harmful effects on outcomes, others continue to have concern regarding the increased possibility of an aspiration event (choking on recently eaten foods) in the event of an emergency delivery due to the increased relaxation of the esophagus in pregnancy, upward pressure of the uterus on the stomach, and the possibility of general anesthetic in the event of an emergency cesarean. A 2013 found that with good obstetrical anaesthesia there is no change in harms from allowing eating and drinking during labour in those who are unlikely to need surgery. They additionally acknowledge that not eating does not mean there is an empty stomach or that its contents are not as acidic. They therefore conclude that ""women should be free to eat and drink in labour, or not, as they wish."" At one time shaving of the , was common practice due to the belief that hair removal reduced the risk of infection, made an (a surgical cut to enlarge the vaginal entrance) easier, and helped with instrumental deliveries. It is currently less common, though it is still a routine procedure in some countries even though a systematic review found no evidence to recommend shaving. Side effects appear later, including irritation, redness, and multiple superficial scratches from the razor. Another effort to prevent infection has been the use of the antiseptic or in the vagina. Evidence of benefit with chlorhexidine is lacking. A decreased risk is found with providone-iodine when a cesarean section is to be performed. An assisted delivery is used in about 1 in 8 births, and may be needed if either mother or infant appears to be at risk during a vaginal delivery. The methods used are termed extraction and , also called ventouse extraction. Done properly, they are both safe with some preference for forceps rather than vacuum, and both are seen as preferable to an unexpected C-section. While considered safe, some risks for the mother include vaginal tearing, including a higher chance of having a more major vaginal tear that involves the muscle or wall of the anus or rectum. There is a higher risks of blood clots forming in the legs or pelvis -- anti-clot stockings or medication may be ordered to avoid clots. is not unusual after childbirth but it is more common after an instrument delivery. Certain exercises and physiotherapy will help the condition to improve. Some women prefer to avoid medication during childbirth. Psychological preparation may be beneficial. Relaxation techniques, immersion in water, massage, and may provide pain relief. Acupuncture and relaxation were found to decrease the number of caesarean sections required. Immersion in water has been found to relieve pain during the first stage of labor and to reduce the need for anesthesia and shorten the duration of labor, however the safety and efficacy of immersion during birth, , has not been established or associated with maternal or fetal benefit. Most women like to have someone to support them during labour and birth; such as a midwife, nurse, or ; or a lay person such as the father of the baby, a family member, or a close friend. Studies have found that continuous support during labor and delivery reduce the need for medication and a caesarean or operative vaginal delivery, and result in an improved for the infant Different measures for pain control have varying degrees of success and side effects to the woman and her baby. In some countries of Europe, doctors commonly prescribe inhaled gas for pain control, especially as 53% nitrous oxide, 47% oxygen, known as ; in the UK, midwives may use this gas without a doctor's prescription. such as may be used, but if given too close to birth there is a risk of respiratory depression in the infant. Popular medical pain control in hospitals include the regional anesthetics (EDA), and . Epidural analgesia is a generally safe and effective method of relieving pain in labour, but has been associated with longer labour, more operative intervention (particularly instrument delivery), and increases in cost. However, a more recent (2017) Cochrane review suggests that the new epidural techniques have no effect on labour time and the use of instruments or the need for C-section deliveries. Generally, pain and stress hormones rise throughout labour for women without epidurals, while pain, fear, and stress hormones decrease upon administration of epidural analgesia, but rise again later. Medicine administered via epidural can cross the placenta and enter the bloodstream of the fetus. Epidural analgesia has no statistically significant impact on the risk of caesarean section, and does not appear to have an immediate effect on neonatal status as determined by Apgar scores. Oxytocin facilitates labour and will follow a loop. Augmentation is the process of stimulating the uterus to increase the intensity and duration of contractions after labour has begun. Several methods of augmentation are commonly been used to treat slow progress of labour (dystocia) when uterine contractions are assessed to be too weak. is the most common method used to increase the rate of vaginal delivery. The World Health Organization recommends its use either alone or with (rupture of the amniotic membrane) but advises that it must be used only after it has been correctly confirmed that labour is not proceeding properly if harm is to be avoided. The WHO does not recommend the use of agents for prevention of delay in labour. For years an was thought to help prevent more extensive vaginal tears and heal better than a natural tear. can occur at the vaginal opening as the baby's head passes through, especially if the baby descends quickly. Tears can involve the or extend to the muscles and the anal sphincter and anus. Once common, they are now recognized as generally not needed. When needed, the midwife or obstetrician makes a surgical cut in the perineum to prevent severe tears that can be difficult to repair. A 2017 Cochrane review compared episiotomy as needed (restrictive) with routine episiotomy to determine the possible benefits and harms for mother and baby. The review found that restrictive episiotomy policies appeared to give a number of benefits compared with using routine episiotomy. Women experienced less severe perineal trauma, less posterior perineal trauma, less suturing and fewer healing complications at seven days with no difference in occurrence of pain, urinary incontinence, painful sex or severe vaginal/perineal trauma after birth. In cases of a first twin, twins can often be delivered vaginally. In some cases twin delivery is done in a larger delivery room or in an operating theatre, in the event of complication e.g. Both twins born vaginally—this can occur both presented head first or where one comes head first and the other is breech and/or helped by a forceps/ventouse delivery One twin born vaginally and the other by caesarean section. If the twins are joined at any part of the body—called , delivery is mostly by caesarean section. Obstetric care frequently subjects women to institutional routines, which may have adverse effects on the progress of labour. Supportive care during labour may involve emotional support, comfort measures, and information and advocacy which may promote the physical process of labour as well as women's feelings of control and competence, thus reducing the need for obstetric intervention. The continuous support may be provided either by hospital staff such as nurses or midwives, , or by companions of the woman's choice from her social network. A 2015 Cochrane review examined interventions for women who perceived childbirth as being traumatic but failed to find any evidence to support routine debriefing as a needed intervention after childbirth. There is increasing evidence to show that the participation of the child's father in the birth leads to better birth and also post-birth outcomes, providing the father does not exhibit excessive anxiety. Continuous labour support may help women to give birth spontaneously, i.e. without caesarean or vacuum or forceps, with slightly shorter labours, and to have more positive feelings regarding their experience of giving birth. Continuous labour support may also reduce women's use of pain medication during labour and reduce the risk of babies having low five-minute Agpar scores. For of the fetus during childbirth, a simple or ("""") can be used. A method of external (noninvasive) fetal (EFM) during childbirth is (CTG), using a that consists of two sensors: The (cardio) sensor is an , similar to a , that continuously emits ultrasound and detects motion of the fetal heart by the characteristic of the reflected sound. The pressure-sensitive transducer, called a (toco) has a flat area that is fixated to the skin by a band around the belly. The pressure required to flatten a section of the wall correlates with the internal pressure, thereby providing an estimate of contraction. Monitoring with a cardiotocograph can either be intermittent or continuous. The (WHO) advises that for healthy women undergoing spontaneous labour continuous cardiotocography is not recommended for assessment of fetal well-being. The WHO states: ""In countries and settings where continuous CTG is used defensively to protect against litigation, all stakeholders should be made aware that this practice is not evidence-based and does not improve birth outcomes."" A mother's water has to break before internal (invasive) monitoring can be used. More invasive monitoring can involve a to give an additional measure of fetal heart activity, and/or (IUPC). It can also involve . for maternal conditions per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. for perinatal conditions per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Per figures retrieved in 2015, since 1990 there has been a 44 per cent decline in the maternal death rate. However, according to 2015 figures 830 women die every day from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth and for every woman who dies, 20 or 30 encounter injuries, infections or disabilities. Most of these deaths and injuries are preventable. In 2008, noting that each year more than 100,000 women die of complications of pregnancy and childbirth and at least seven million experience serious health problems while 50 million more have adverse health consequences after childbirth, the (WHO) has urged midwife training to strengthen maternal and newborn health services. To support the upgrading of midwifery skills the WHO established a midwife training program, Action for Safe Motherhood. The rising maternal death rate in the US is of concern. In 1990 the US ranked 12th of the 14 developed countries that were analyzed. However, since that time the rates of every country have steadily continued to improve while the US rate has spiked dramatically. While every other developed nation of the 14 analyzed in 1990 shows a 2017 death rate of less than 10 deaths per every 100,000 live births, the US rate has risen to 26.4. By comparison, the United Kingdom ranks second highest at 9.2 and Finland is the safest at 3.8. Furthermore, for every one of the 700 to 900 US woman who die each year during pregnancy or childbirth, 70 experience significant complications such as hemorrhage and organ failure, totaling more than one percent of all births. Compared to other developed nations, the United States also has high infant mortality rates. The reports that as of 2011, about one-third of American births have some complications; many are directly related to the mother's health including increasing rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and physical inactivity. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has led an initiative to improve woman's health previous to conception in an effort to improve both neonatal and maternal death rates. The second stage of labour may be delayed or lengthy due to poor or uncoordinated uterine action, an abnormal uterine position such as or , and cephalopelvic disproportion (a small pelvis or large infant). Prolonged labour may result in maternal exhaustion, fetal distress, and other complications including . Eclampsia is the onset of seizures (convulsions) in a woman with pre-eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy in which there is high blood pressure and either large amounts of protein in the urine or other organ dysfunction. Pre-eclampsia is routinely screened for during prenatal care. Onset may be before, during, or rarely, after delivery. Around one percent of women with eclampsia die. A puerperal disorder or postpartum disorder is a complication which presents primarily during the puerperium, or postpartum period. The postpartum period can be divided into three distinct stages; the initial or acute phase, six to 12 hours after childbirth; subacute postpartum period, which lasts two to six weeks, and the delayed postpartum period, which can last up to six months. In the subacute postpartum period, 87% to 94% of women report at least one health problem. Long term health problems (persisting after the delayed postpartum period) are reported by 31 percent of women. Postpartum bleeding is the leading cause of death of birthing mothers in the world, especially in the developing world. Globally it occurs about 8.7 million times and results in 44,000 to 86,000 deaths per year. Uterine atony, the inability of the uterus to contract, is the most common cause of postpartum bleeding. Following delivery of the placenta, the uterus is left with a large area of open blood vessels which must be constricted to avoid blood loss. Retained placental tissue and infection may contribute to uterine atony. Heavy blood loss leads to , insufficient perfusion of vital organs and death if not rapidly treated. Postpartum infections, also known as childbed fever and puerperal fever, are any bacterial infections of the reproductive tract following childbirth or miscarriage. Signs and symptoms usually include a fever greater than 38.0 °C (100.4 °F), chills, lower abdominal pain, and possibly bad-smelling vaginal discharge. The infection usually occurs after the first 24 hours and within the first ten days following delivery. Infection remains a major cause of maternal deaths and morbidity in the developing world. The work of was seminal in the pathophysiology and treatment of childbed fever and his work saved many lives. Main articles: , , , , and Childbirth can be an intense event and strong emotions, both positive and negative, can be brought to the surface. Abnormal and persistent fear of childbirth is known as . The prevalence of fear of childbirth around the world ranges between 4–25%, with 3–7% of pregnant women having clinical fear of childbirth. Most new mothers may experience mild feelings of unhappiness and worry after giving birth. Babies require a lot of care, so it is normal for mothers to be worried about, or tired from, providing that care. The feelings, often termed the , affect up to 80 percent of mothers. They are somewhat mild, last a week or two, and usually go away on their own. is different from the ""baby blues"". With postpartum depression, feelings of sadness and anxiety can be extreme and might interfere with a woman's ability to care for herself or her family. Because of the severity of the symptoms, postpartum depression usually requires treatment. The condition, which occurs in nearly 15 percent of births, may begin shortly before or any time after childbirth, but commonly begins between a week and a month after delivery. is a psychological disorder that can develop in women who have recently given birth. Causes include issues such as an emergency C-section, preterm labour, inadequate care during labour, lack of social support following childbirth, and others. Examples of symptoms include , and , as well as symptoms of (including for the whole or parts of the event), problems in developing a , and others similar to those commonly experienced in (PTSD). Many women who are experiencing symptoms of PTSD after childbirth are misdiagnosed with postpartum depression or . These diagnoses can lead to inadequate treatment. is a rare in which symptoms of high mood and racing thoughts (), depression, severe confusion, loss of inhibition, paranoia, hallucinations and delusions set in, beginning suddenly in the first two weeks after childbirth. The symptoms vary and can change quickly. It usually requires hospitalization. The most severe symptoms last from two to 12 weeks, and recovery takes six months to a year. Mechanical fetal injury may be caused by improper rotation of the fetus. Five causes make up about 80 percent of newborn deaths. They include prematurity and low-birth-weight, infections, lack of oxygen at birth, and trauma during birth. Stillbirth is typically defined as death at or after 20 to 28 weeks of pregnancy. It results in a baby born without . Worldwide prevention of most stillbirths is possible with improved health systems. About half of stillbirths occur during childbirth, with this being more common in the than . Otherwise depending on how far along the pregnancy is, or a type of surgery known as may be carried out. Following a stillbirth, women are at higher risk of another one; however, most subsequent pregnancies do not have similar problems. Worldwide in 2015 there were about 2.6 million stillbirths that occurred after 28 weeks of pregnancy (about 1 for every 45 births). They occur most commonly in the developing world, particularly and . In the United States for every 167 births there is one stillbirth. Stillbirth rates have declined, though more slowly since the 2000s. Preterm birth is the birth of an infant at fewer than 37 weeks . It is estimated that one in 10 babies are born prematurely. Premature birth is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age though many that survive experience disabilities including learning defects and visual and hearing problems. Causes for early birth may be unknown or may be related to certain chronic conditions such as diabetes, infections, and other known causes. The World Health Organization has developed guidelines with recommendations to improve the chances of survival and health outcomes for preterm infants. for neonatal infections and other (perinatal) conditions per 100,000 inhabitants in 2004. Excludes and low birth weight, and which have their own maps/data. Newborns are prone to infection in the first month of life. The organism (Group B Streptococcus) or (GBS) is most often the cause of these occasionally fatal infections. The baby contracts the infection from the mother during labor. In 2014 it was estimated that about one in 2000 newborn babies have GBS bacterial infections within the first week of life, usually evident as respiratory disease, general , or . Untreated (STIs) are associated with and infections in newborn babies, particularly in the areas where rates of infection remain high. The majority of STIs have no symptoms or only mild symptoms that may not be recognized. Mortality rates resulting from some infections may be high, for example the overall perinatal mortality rate associated with untreated syphilis is 30 percent. is the medical condition resulting from to a newborn infant that lasts long enough during the birth process to cause physical harm, usually to the brain. Hypoxic damage can occur to most of the infant's organs (, , , , ), but is of most concern and perhaps the least likely to quickly or completely heal. Risk factors for fetal birth injury include (big baby), , the need for instrumental delivery, and an inexperienced attendant. Specific situations that can contribute to birth injury include breech presentation and . Most fetal birth injuries resolve without long term harm, but may lead to or . See also: , and The process of childbirth in Western society has evolved significantly over the years. Historically women have been attended and supported by other women during labour and birth. Midwife training in European cities began in the 1400s, but rural women were usually assisted by female family or friends. However, it was not simply a ladies' social bonding event as some historians have portrayed - fear and pain often filled the atmosphere, as death during childbirth was a common occurrence. In the United States, before the 1950s the husband would not be in the birthing room. It did not matter if it was a ; the husband was waiting downstairs or in another room in the home. If it was in a hospital then the husband was in the waiting room. Fathers were only permitted in the room if the life of the mother or baby was severely at-risk. In 1522, a German physician was sentenced to death for sneaking into a delivery room dressed as a woman. Ironically, the majority of guidebooks related to pregnancy and childbirth were written by men who had never been involved in the birthing process. A Greek physician, , wrote a book about obstetrics and gynecology in the second century, which was referenced for the next thousand years. The book contained endless home remedies for pregnancy and childbirth, many of which would be considered heinous by modern women and medical professionals. Both preterm and full term infants benefit from skin to skin contact, sometimes called , immediately following birth and for the first few weeks of life. Recently some fathers have also begun to hold their newborns skin to skin as well. The new baby is familiar with the father's voice and it is believed that contact with the father helps the infant to stabilize and promotes father to infant bonding. If the infant's mother had a caesarean birth, the father can hold their baby in skin-to-skin contact while the mother recovers from the anesthetic. Historically, most women gave birth at home without emergency medical care available. In the early days of hospitalization of childbirth, a 17th-century maternity ward in Paris was incredibly congested, with up to five pregnant women sharing one bed. At this hospital, one in five women died during the birthing process. At the onset of the , giving birth at home became more difficult due to congested living spaces and dirty living conditions. That drove urban and lower-class women to newly-available hospitals, while wealthy and middle-class women continued to labor at home. Consequently, wealthier women experienced lower maternal mortality rates than those of a lower social class. Throughout the 1900s there was an increasing availability of hospitals, and more women began going into the hospital for labor and delivery. In the United States, 5% of women gave birth in hospitals in 1900. By 1930, 50% of all women and 75% of urban-dwelling women delivered in hospitals. By 1960, this number increased to 96%. By the 1970s, home birth rates fell to approximately 1%. In the United States, the middle classes were especially receptive to the medicalization of childbirth, which promised a safer and less painful labor. Accompanied by the shift from home to hospital was the shift from midwife to physician. Male physicians began to replace female midwives in Europe and the United States in the 1700s. The rise in status and popularity of this new position was accompanied by a drop in status for midwives. By the 1800s, affluent families were primarily calling male doctors to assist with their deliveries, and female midwives were seen as a resource for women who could not afford better care. That completely removed women from assisting in labor, as only men were eligible to become doctors at the time. Additionally, it privatized the birthing process as family members and friends were often banned from the delivery room. There was opposition to the change from both progressive feminists and religious conservatives. The feminists were concerned about job security for a role that had traditionally been held by women. The conservatives argued that it was immoral for a woman to be exposed in such a way in front of a man. For that reason, many male obstetricians performed deliveries in dark rooms or with their patient fully covered with a drape. The use of pain medication in labor has been a controversial issue for hundreds of years. A Scottish woman was burned at the stake in 1591 for requesting pain relief in the delivery of twins. Medication became more acceptable in 1852, when Queen Victoria used chloroform as pain relief during labor. The use of and , also known as "","" was first used in Germany and popularized by German physicians Bernard Kronig and Karl Gauss. This concoction offered minor pain relief but mostly allowed women to completely forget the entire delivery process. Under twilight sleep, mothers were often blindfolded and restrained as they experienced the immense pain of childbirth. The cocktail came with severe side effects, such as decreased uterine contractions and altered mental state. Additionally, babies delivered with the use of childbirth drugs often experienced temporarily-ceased breathing. The feminist movement in the United States openly and actively supported the use of twilight sleep, which was introduced to the country in 1914. Some physicians, many of whom had been using painkillers for the past fifty years, including opium, cocaine, and quinine, embraced the new drug. Others were rightfully hesitant. While forceps have gone through periods of high popularity, today they are only used in approximately 10 percent of deliveries. The has become the more popular solution for difficult deliveries. In 2005, one-third of babies were born via C-section. Historically, surgical delivery was a last-resort method of extracting a baby from its deceased or dying mother. There are many conflicting stories of the first successful C-section in which both mother and baby survived. It is, however, known that the procedure had been attempted for hundreds of years before it became accepted in the beginning of the twentieth century. The re-emergence of ""natural childbirth"" began in Europe and was adopted by some in the US as early as the late 1940s. Early supporters believed that the drugs used during deliveries interfered with ""happy childbirth"" and could negatively impact the newborn's ""emotional wellbeing."" By the 1970s, the call for natural childbirth was spread nationwide, in conjunction with While it is still most common for American women to deliver in the hospital, supporters of natural birth still widely exist, especially in the UK where midwife-assisted home births have gained popularity in recent years. 810 women die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. 94% occur in low and lower middle-income countries. estimated that 303,000 women died of pregnancy or childbirth related causes in 2015. These causes range from to , for which there are highly effective interventions. As women have gained access to and skilled with backup emergency obstetric care, the global maternal mortality ratio has fallen from 385 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births in 1990 to 216 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2015, and many countries halved their maternal death rates in the last 10 years. Since the US began recording childbirth statistics in 1915, the US has had historically poor maternal mortality rates in comparison to other developed countries. Britain started recording maternal mortality data from 1880 onward. Outcomes for mothers in childbirth were especially poor before 1930, because of high rates of . Until was accepted in the mid-1800s, it was assumed that puerperal fever was caused by a variety of sources, including the leakage of breast milk into the body and anxiety. Later, it was discovered that puerperal fever was transmitted by the dirty hands and tools of doctors. That was likely responsible for the high prevalence of puerperal fever. Home births facilitated by trained midwives produced the best outcomes from 1880 to 1930 in the US and Europe, whereas physician-facilitated hospital births produced the worst. The change in trend of maternal mortality can be attributed with the widespread use of (the first broadly effective antibacterial drugs), along with the progression of medical technology, more extensive physician training, and less medical interference with normal deliveries. Medieval woman, having given birth, enjoying her (). France, 14th century Cost of childbirth in several countries in 2012. According to a 2013 analysis performed commissioned by the New York Times and performed by Truven Healthcare Analytics, the cost of childbirth varies dramatically by country. In the United States the average amount actually paid by insurance companies or other payers in 2012 averaged $9,775 for an uncomplicated conventional delivery and $15,041 for a caesarean birth. The aggregate charges of healthcare facilities for four million annual births in the United States was estimated at over $50 billion. The summed cost of prenatal care, childbirth, and newborn care came to $30,000 for a vaginal delivery and $50,000 for a caesarian section. In the United States, childbirth hospital stays have some of the lowest ICU utilizations. Vaginal delivery with and without complicating diagnoses and caesarean section with and without comorbidities or major comorbidities account for four of the 15 types of hospital stays with low rates of ICU utilization (where less than 20% of visits were admitted to the ICU). During stays with ICU services, approximately 20% of costs were attributable to the ICU. A 2013 study found varying costs by facility for childbirth expenses in California, varying from $3,296 to $37,227 for a vaginal birth and from $8,312 to $70,908 for a caesarean birth. Beginning in 2014, the began recommending that many women give birth at home under the care of a midwife rather than an obstetrician, citing lower expenses and better healthcare outcomes. The median cost associated with home birth was estimated to be about $1,500 vs. about $2,500 in hospital. Childbirth routinely occurs in hospitals in many . Before the 20th century and in some countries to the present day, such as , it has more typically occurred at home. In rural and of many countries, hospitalized childbirth may not be readily available or the best option. Maternal evacuation is the predominant risk management method for assisting mothers in these communities. Maternal evacuation is the process of relocating pregnant women in remote communities to deliver their babies in a nearby urban hospital setting. This practice is common in Indigenous and Northern Manitoban communities in as well as aboriginal communities. There has been research considering the negative effects of maternal evacuation due to a lack of social support provided to these women. These negative effects include an increase in maternal newborn complications and postpartum depression, and decreased breastfeeding rates. The in which childbirth takes place is an important factor in determining nationality, in particular for . Following are facilities that are particularly intended to house women during childbirth: A , also called a or , is generally a that focuses on providing to women and their children during childbirth. It is generally closely linked to the hospital's and/or unit if present. A or may include facilities both for childbirth and for rest and observation of mothers in normal as well as complicated cases. A is a hospital that specializes in caring for women while they are pregnant and during childbirth and provide care for newborn babies, A generally presents a simulated home-like environment. Birthing centers may be located on hospital grounds or ""free standing"" (i.e., not hospital-affiliated). In addition, it is possible to have a , usually with the assist of a midwife. However, some women choose to give birth at home without any professionals present, termed an . Model of pelvis used in the beginning of the 19th century to teach technical procedures for a successful childbirth. Museum of the History of Medicine, , Different categories of may provide support and care during pregnancy and childbirth, although there are important differences across categories based on professional training and skills, practice regulations, and the nature of care delivered. Many of these occupations are highly professionalised, but other roles exist on a less formal basis. ""Childbirth educators"" are instructors who aim to teach pregnant women and their partners about the nature of pregnancy, labour signs and stages, techniques for giving birth, breastfeeding and newborn baby care. Training for this role can be found in hospital settings or through independent certifying organizations. Each organization teaches its own curriculum and each emphasizes different techniques. The is one well-known example. are assistants who support mothers during pregnancy, labour, birth, and postpartum. They are not medical attendants; rather, they provide emotional support and non-medical pain relief for women during labour. Like childbirth educators and other , certification to become a doula is not compulsory, thus, anyone can call themself a doula or a childbirth educator. are individuals who are employed to provide assistance and stay with the mothers at their home after childbirth. They are usually experienced mothers who took courses on how to take care of mothers and newborn babies. are autonomous practitioners who provide basic and emergency health care before, during and after pregnancy and childbirth, generally to women with low-risk pregnancies. Midwives are trained to assist during labour and birth, either through direct-entry or nurse-midwifery education programs. Jurisdictions where midwifery is a regulated profession will typically have a registering and disciplinary body for quality control, such as the American Midwifery Certification Board in the United States, the College of Midwives of British Columbia in Canada or the in the United Kingdom. In the past, midwifery played a crucial role in childbirth throughout most indigenous societies. Although western civilizations attempted to assimilate their birthing technologies into certain indigenous societies, like , and get rid of the midwifery, the National Aboriginal Council of Midwives brought back the cultural ideas and midwifery that were once associated with indigenous birthing. In jurisdictions where midwifery is not a regulated profession, , also known as traditional or lay midwives, may assist women during childbirth, although they do not typically receive formal health care education and training. who practice in the field of childbirth include categorically specialized , and whose training, skills and practices include obstetrics, and in some contexts . These physicians and surgeons variously provide care across the whole spectrum of normal and abnormal births and pathological labour conditions. Categorically specialized obstetricians are qualified , so they can undertake surgical procedures relating to childbirth. Some family practitioners or general practitioners also perform obstetrical surgery. Obstetrical procedures include , , and assisted delivery. Categorical specialists in obstetrics are commonly trained in both (OB/GYN), and may provide other medical and surgical gynecological care, and may incorporate more general, well-woman, elements in their practices. specialists are obstetrician/gynecologists subspecialized in managing and treating high-risk pregnancy and delivery. or are medical doctors who specialise in pain relief and the use of drugs to facilitate surgery and other painful procedures. They may contribute to the care of a woman in labour by performing an or by providing (often ) for or .

A comes to see the mother and baby at home, usually within 24 hours of discharge, and checks the infant's and the mother's . Cultural values, assumptions, and practices of pregnancy and childbirth vary across cultures. For example, some women who work in agricultural fields of some rural communities will usually continue to work in a similar function to how they normally would throughout pregnancy, in some cases working until labor begins. and proximity to extended family and social support systems may be a childbirth priority of many communities in developing countries, such as the Chillihuani in Peru and the Mayan town of San Pedro La Laguna. Home births can help women in these cultures feel more comfortable as they are in their own home with their family around them helping out in different ways. Traditionally, it has been rare in these cultures for the mother to lie down during childbirth, opting instead for standing, kneeling, or walking around prior to and during birthing. Some communities rely heavily on religion for their birthing practices. It is believed that if certain acts are carried out, then it will allow the child for a healthier and happier future. One example of this is the belief in the Chillihuani that if a knife or scissors are used for cutting the , it will cause for the child to go through clothes very quickly. In order to prevent this, a jagged ceramic tile is used to cut the umbilical cord. In Mayan societies, ceremonial gifts are presented to the mother throughout pregnancy and childbirth in order to help her into the beginning of her child's life. Ceremonies and customs can vary greatly between countries. See; It is currently possible to collect two types of during childbirth: and umbilical stem cells. They are being studied as possible treatments of a number of conditions.

The of pregnancy is, unless otherwise specified, generally given as , where the starting point is the beginning of the woman's (LMP), or the corresponding age of the gestation as estimated by a more accurate method if available. Sometimes, timing may also use the which is the age of the embryo. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend the following methods to calculate gestational age: Directly calculating the days since the beginning of the . Early , comparing the size of an or to that of a of pregnancies of known gestational age (such as calculated from last menstrual periods), and using the mean gestational age of other embryos or fetuses of the same size. If the gestational age as calculated from an early ultrasound is contradictory to the one calculated directly from the last menstrual period, it is still the one from the early ultrasound that is used for the rest of the pregnancy. In case of , calculating days since or and adding 14 days. Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, each lasting for approximately 3 months. The exact length of each trimester can vary between sources. The begins with the start of gestational age as described above, that is, the beginning of week 1, or 0 weeks + 0 days of gestational age (GA). It ends at week 12 (11 weeks + 6 days of GA) or end of week 14 (13 weeks + 6 days of GA). The is defined as starting, between the beginning of week 13 (12 weeks +0 days of GA) and beginning of week 15 (14 weeks + 0 days of GA).

Timeline of pregnancy, including (from top to bottom): Trimesters, embryo/fetus development, in weeks and months, viability and maturity stages. Distribution of gestational age at childbirth among singleton live births, given both when is estimated by first trimester ultrasound and directly by last menstrual period. Roughly 80% of births occur between 37 and 41 weeks of gestational age. Determination of which time point is to be used as for , as described in the section above. Adding the estimated gestational age at childbirth to the above time point. Childbirth on average occurs at a gestational age of 280 days (40 weeks), which is therefore often used as a standard estimation for individual pregnancies. However, alternative durations as well as more individualized methods have also been suggested. is a standard way of calculating the due date for a pregnancy when assuming a gestational age of 280 days at childbirth. The rule estimates the expected date of delivery (EDD) by adding a year, subtracting three months, and adding seven days to the origin of gestational age. Alternatively there are , which essentially always give consistent estimations compared to each other and correct for , while pregnancy wheels made of paper can differ from each other by 7 days and generally do not correct for leap year. Furthermore, actual childbirth has only a certain probability of occurring within the limits of the estimated due date. A study of singleton live births came to the result that childbirth has a of 14 days when gestational age is estimated by first trimester , and 16 days when estimated directly by last menstrual period.

Fertilization usually occurs about two weeks before the expected menstrual period. A third point in time is also considered by some people to be the true beginning of a pregnancy: This is time of implantation, when the future fetus attaches to the lining of the uterus. This is about a week to ten days after fertilization. Main articles: , , and The sperm and the egg cell, which has been released from one of the female's two , unite in one of the two . The fertilized egg, known as a , then moves toward the uterus, a journey that can take up to a week to complete. Cell division begins approximately 24 to 36 hours after the female and male cells unite. Cell division continues at a rapid rate and the cells then develop into what is known as a . The blastocyst arrives at the uterus and attaches to the uterine wall, a process known as . The development of the mass of cells that will become the infant is called during the first approximately ten weeks of gestation. During this time, cells begin to differentiate into the various body systems. The basic outlines of the organ, body, and nervous systems are established. By the end of the embryonic stage, the beginnings of features such as fingers, eyes, mouth, and ears become visible. Also during this time, there is development of structures important to the support of the embryo, including the and . The connects the developing embryo to the uterine wall to allow nutrient uptake, waste elimination, and gas exchange via the mother's blood supply.

At the beginning of the fetal stage, the risk of miscarriage decreases sharply. At this stage, a fetus is about 30 mm (1.2 inches) in length, the heartbeat is seen via ultrasound, and the fetus makes involuntary motions. During continued fetal development, the early body systems, and structures that were established in the embryonic stage continue to develop. Sex organs begin to appear during the third month of gestation. The fetus continues to grow in both weight and length, although the majority of the physical growth occurs in the last weeks of pregnancy. Electrical is first detected between the fifth and sixth week of gestation. It is considered primitive neural activity rather than the beginning of conscious thought. Synapses begin forming at 17 weeks, and begin to multiply quickly at week 28 until 3 to 4 months after birth. Although the fetus begins to move during the first trimester, it is not until the second trimester that movement, known as , can be felt. This typically happens in the fourth month, more specifically in the 20th to 21st week, or by the 19th week if the woman has been pregnant before. It is common for some women not to feel the fetus move until much later. During the second trimester, most women begin to wear . Embryo at 4 weeks after fertilization. (Gestational age of 6 weeks.)

The areolae are larger and darker. During pregnancy, a woman undergoes many changes, which are entirely normal, including , , , , , and changes. Increases in , , and are all required. Levels of and rise continually throughout pregnancy, suppressing the and therefore also the . A full-term pregnancy at an early age reduces the risk of , and and the risk declines further with each additional full-term pregnancy. The fetus is different from its mother, and can be viewed as an unusually successful . The main reason for this success is increased during pregnancy. Immune tolerance is the concept that the body is able to not mount an immune system response against certain triggers. The uterus as it changes in size over the duration of the trimesters During the first trimester, increases by 40%. The womb will grow to the size of a lemon by eight weeks. Many like nausea and tender breasts appear in the first trimester. By the end of the second trimester, the expanding uterus has created a visible ""baby bump"". Although the breasts have been developing internally since the beginning of the pregnancy, most of the visible changes appear after this point. During the second trimester, most women feel more energized, and begin to put on weight as the symptoms of morning sickness subside and eventually fade away. The uterus, the muscular organ that holds the developing fetus, can expand up to 20 times its normal size during pregnancy. Pregnant woman in third trimester of pregnancy (last month) The expands making up a larger and larger portion of the woman's abdomen. At left anterior view with months labeled, at right lateral view labeling the last 4 weeks. During the final stages of gestation before childbirth the fetus and uterus will drop to a lower position. Final weight gain takes place during the third trimester, which is the most weight gain throughout the pregnancy. The woman's abdomen will transform in shape as it drops due to the fetus turning in a downward position ready for birth. During the second trimester, the woman's abdomen would have been upright, whereas in the third trimester it will drop down low. The fetus moves regularly, and is felt by the woman. Fetal movement can become strong and be disruptive to the woman. The woman's will sometimes become convex, ""popping"" out, due to the expanding . , where the fetal head descends into , relieves pressure on the upper abdomen with renewed ease in breathing. It also severely reduces bladder capacity, and increases pressure on the pelvic floor and the rectum. It is also during the third trimester that maternal activity and sleep positions may affect fetal development due to restricted blood flow. For instance, the enlarged uterus may impede blood flow by compressing the when lying flat, which is relieved by lying on the left side. Childbirth, referred to as labor and delivery in the medical field, is the process whereby an infant is born. A woman is considered to be in labour when she begins experiencing regular uterine contractions, accompanied by changes of her cervix – primarily effacement and dilation. While childbirth is widely experienced as painful, some women do report painless labours, while others find that concentrating on the birth helps to quicken labour and lessen the sensations. Most births are successful vaginal births, but sometimes complications arise and a woman may undergo a . During the time immediately after birth, both the mother and the baby are hormonally cued to bond, the mother through the release of , a hormone also released during . Studies show that skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn immediately after birth is beneficial for both the mother and baby. A review done by the found that skin-to-skin contact between mothers and babies after birth reduces crying, improves mother–infant interaction, and helps mothers to breastfeed successfully. They recommend that be allowed to bond with the mother during their first two hours after birth, the period that they tend to be more alert than in the following hours of early life. Further information: and In the ideal labor begins on its own when a woman is ""at term"". Events before completion of 37 weeks are considered preterm. is associated with a range of complications and should be avoided if possible. Sometimes if a woman's or she has before 39 weeks, birth is unavoidable. However, spontaneous birth after 37 weeks is considered term and is not associated with the same risks of a pre-term birth. Planned birth before 39 weeks by or , although ""at term"", results in an increased risk of complications. This is from factors including , infection due to underdeveloped immune system, feeding problems due to underdeveloped brain, and from underdeveloped liver. Babies born between 39 and 41 weeks gestation have better outcomes than babies born either before or after this range. This special time period is called ""full term"". Whenever possible, waiting for labor to begin on its own in this time period is best for the health of the mother and baby. The decision to perform an induction must be made after weighing the risks and benefits, but is safer after 39 weeks. Events after 42 weeks are considered . When a pregnancy exceeds 42 weeks, the risk of complications for both the woman and the fetus increases significantly. Therefore, in an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy, obstetricians usually prefer to at some stage between 41 and 42 weeks. The postnatal period, also referred to as the , begins immediately after delivery and extends for about six weeks. During this period, the mother's body begins the return to pre-pregnancy conditions that includes changes in hormone levels and uterus size. The beginning of pregnancy may be detected either based on symptoms by the woman herself, or by using . However, an important condition with serious health implications that is quite common is the by the pregnant woman. About one in 475 denials will last until around the 20th week of pregnancy. The proportion of cases of denial, persisting until delivery is about 1 in 2500. Conversely, some non-pregnant women have a very strong belief that they are pregnant along with some of the physical changes. This condition is known as a . Further information: Most pregnant women experience a number of symptoms, which can signify pregnancy. A number of early are associated with pregnancy. These signs include: the presence of (hCG) in the blood and urine implantation bleeding that occurs at of the embryo in the uterus during the third or fourth week after last menstrual period increased sustained for over 2 weeks after (darkening of the , , and ) (softening of the vaginal portion of the cervix) Pigmentation of the – , (darkening of the skin in a midline of the , caused by resulting from hormonal changes, usually appearing around the middle of pregnancy). Darkening of the nipples and areolas due to an increase in hormones. Pregnancy detection can be accomplished using one or more various , which detect hormones generated by the newly formed , serving as of pregnancy. Blood and urine tests can detect pregnancy 12 days after implantation. Blood pregnancy tests are more sensitive than urine tests (giving fewer false negatives). Home are tests, and normally detect a pregnancy 12 to 15 days after fertilization. A quantitative blood test can determine approximately the date the embryo was conceived because doubles every 36 to 48 hours. A single test of levels can also help determine how likely a fetus will survive in those with a (bleeding in early pregnancy). can detect , detect , and improve gestational dating at 24 weeks. The resultant estimated and due date of the fetus are slightly more accurate than methods based on last menstrual period. Ultrasound is used to measure the in order to screen for .

Main articles: and is care that is provided to a woman and/ or couple to discuss conception, pregnancy, current health issues and recommendations for the period before pregnancy. is the medical and nursing care recommended for women during pregnancy, time intervals and exact goals of each visit differ by country. Women who are high risk have better outcomes if they are seen regularly and frequently by a medical professional than women who are low risk. A woman can be labeled as high risk for different reasons including previous complications in pregnancy, complications in the current pregnancy, current medical diseases, or social issues. The aim of good prenatal care is prevention, early identification, and treatment of any medical complications. A basic prenatal visit consists of measurement of blood pressure, , weight and fetal heart rate, checking for symptoms of labor, and guidance for what to expect next. during pregnancy is important to ensure healthy growth of the fetus. Nutrition during pregnancy is different from the non-pregnant state. There are increased energy requirements and specific micronutrient requirements. Women benefit from education to encourage a balanced energy and protein intake during pregnancy. Some women may need professional medical advice if their diet is affected by medical conditions, food allergies, or specific religious/ ethical beliefs. Further studies are needed to access the effect of dietary advice to prevent , although low quality evidence suggests some benefit. Adequate periconceptional (time before and right after conception) (also called folate or Vitamin B) intake has been shown to decrease the risk of fetal neural tube defects, such as . The neural tube develops during the first 28 days of pregnancy, a urine pregnancy test is not usually positive until 14 days post-conception, explaining the necessity to guarantee adequate folate intake before conception. Folate is abundant in , , and . In the United States and Canada, most wheat products (flour, noodles) are fortified with folic acid. is a major structural fatty acid in the brain and retina, and is naturally found in breast milk. It is important for the woman to consume adequate amounts of DHA during pregnancy and while nursing to support her well-being and the health of her infant. Developing infants cannot produce DHA efficiently, and must receive this vital nutrient from the woman through the placenta during pregnancy and in breast milk after birth. Several are important for the health of the developing fetus, especially in areas of the world where insufficient nutrition is common. Women living in low and middle income countries are suggested to take multiple micronutrient supplements containing iron and folic acid. These supplements have been shown to improve birth outcomes in developing countries, but do not have an effect on perinatal mortality. Adequate intake of folic acid, and iron is often recommended. In developed areas, such as Western Europe and the United States, certain nutrients such as and , required for bone development, may also require supplementation. Vitamin E supplementation has not been shown to improve birth outcomes. Zinc supplementation has been associated with a decrease in preterm birth, but it is unclear whether it is causative. Daily iron supplementation reduces the risk of maternal anemia. Studies of routine daily iron supplementation for pregnant women found improvement in blood iron levels, without a clear clinical benefit. The nutritional needs for women carrying twins or triplets are higher than those of women carrying one baby. Women are counseled to avoid certain foods, because of the possibility of contamination with bacteria or parasites that can cause illness. Careful washing of fruits and raw vegetables may remove these pathogens, as may thoroughly cooking leftovers, meat, or processed meat. Unpasteurized dairy and deli meats may contain which can cause neonatal meningitis, stillbirth and miscarriage. Pregnant women are also more prone to infections, can be in eggs and poultry, which should be thoroughly cooked. Cat feces and undercooked meats may contain the parasite and can cause . Practicing good hygiene in the kitchen can reduce these risks. Women are also counseled to eat seafood in moderation and to eliminate seafood known to be high in mercury because of the risk of birth defects. Pregnant women are counseled to consume caffeine in moderation, because large amounts of caffeine are associated with miscarriage. However, the relationship between caffeine, birthweight, and preterm birth is unclear. The amount of healthy weight gain during a pregnancy varies. Weight gain is related to the weight of the baby, the placenta, extra circulatory fluid, larger tissues, and fat and protein stores. Most needed weight gain occurs later in pregnancy. The recommends an overall pregnancy weight gain for those of normal weight ( of 18.5–24.9), of 11.3–15.9 kg (25–35 pounds) having a singleton pregnancy. Women who are underweight (BMI of less than 18.5), should gain between 12.7–18 kg (28–40 lb), while those who are (BMI of 25–29.9) are advised to gain between 6.8–11.3 kg (15–25 lb) and those who are (BMI>30) should gain between 5–9 kg (11–20 lb). These values reference the expectations for a term pregnancy. During pregnancy, insufficient or excessive weight gain can compromise the health of the mother and fetus. The most effective intervention for weight gain in underweight women is not clear. Being or becoming overweight in pregnancy increases the risk of complications for mother and fetus, including , , , and . Excessive weight gain can make losing weight after the pregnancy difficult. Some of these complications are risk factors for . Around 50% of women of childbearing age in developed countries like the United Kingdom are overweight or obese before pregnancy. Diet modification is the most effective way to reduce weight gain and associated risks in pregnancy. Drugs used during pregnancy can have temporary or permanent effects on the fetus. Anything (including drugs) that can cause permanent deformities in the fetus are labeled as . In the U.S., drugs were classified into categories A, B, C, D and X based on the (FDA) rating system to provide therapeutic guidance based on potential benefits and fetal risks. Drugs, including some , that have demonstrated no fetal risks after controlled studies in humans are classified as Category A. On the other hand, drugs like with proven fetal risks that outweigh all benefits are classified as Category X. The use of in pregnancy can cause various . during pregnancy can cause one or more . According to the , there is no known safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy and no safe time to drink during pregnancy, including before a woman knows that she is pregnant. can cause a wide range of behavioral, neurological, and physical difficulties.

Further information: A video describing research on N95 respirator use during advanced pregnancy Intrauterine exposure to has the potential to cause adverse effects on , and to cause . Air pollution has been associated with low birth weight infants. Conditions of particular severity in pregnancy include and . To minimize exposure to environmental toxins, the recommends: checking whether the home has , washing all fresh and thoroughly and buying produce, and avoiding cleaning products labeled ""toxic"" or any product with a warning on the label. Pregnant women can also be exposed to , including airborne particles. The effects of wearing N95 filtering facepiece are similar for pregnant women as for non-pregnant women, and wearing a respirator for one hour does not affect the fetal heart rate. Most women can continue to engage in sexual activity throughout pregnancy. Most research suggests that during pregnancy both sexual desire and frequency of sexual relations decrease. In context of this overall decrease in desire, some studies indicate a second-trimester increase, preceding a decrease during the third trimester. Sex during pregnancy is a low-risk behavior except when the healthcare provider advises that sexual intercourse be avoided for particular medical reasons. For a healthy pregnant woman, there is no single or way to have sex during pregnancy. Pregnancy alters the with a reduction in microscopic species/genus diversity. Regular during pregnancy appears to improve (or maintain) physical fitness. during pregnancy does appear to decrease the need for . , outside of research studies, is not recommended as there is no evidence of benefit and potential harm. The Clinical Practice Obstetrics Committee of Canada recommends that ""All women without contraindications should be encouraged to participate in aerobic and strength-conditioning exercises as part of a healthy lifestyle during their pregnancy"". Although an upper level of safe exercise intensity has not been established, women who were regular exercisers before pregnancy and who have uncomplicated pregnancies should be able to engage in high intensity exercise programs. In general, participation in a wide range of recreational activities appears to be safe, with the avoidance of those with a high risk of falling such as horseback riding or skiing or those that carry a risk of abdominal trauma, such as soccer or hockey. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reports that in the past, the main concerns of exercise in pregnancy were focused on the fetus and any potential maternal benefit was thought to be offset by potential risks to the fetus. However, they write that more recent information suggests that in the uncomplicated pregnancy, fetal injuries are highly unlikely. They do, however, list several circumstances when a woman should contact her health care provider before continuing with an exercise program: vaginal bleeding, before exertion, dizziness, headache, chest pain, muscle weakness, preterm labor, decreased fetal movement, amniotic fluid leakage, and calf pain or swelling (to rule out ). It has been suggested that and exposure to bright light at night should be avoided at least during the last trimester of pregnancy to decrease the risk of psychological and behavioral problems in the newborn. The increased levels of and during pregnancy make more likely; the become edematous, red in colour, and tend to bleed. Also a or “pregnancy tumor,” is commonly seen on the labial surface of the papilla. Lesions can be treated by local debridement or deep incision depending on their size, and by following adequate measures. There have been suggestions that severe may increase the risk of having and , however, a Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine if can develop adverse birth outcomes. In low risk pregnancies, most health care providers approve flying until about 36 weeks of gestational age. Most airlines allow pregnant women to fly short distances at less than 36 weeks, and long distances at less than 32 weeks. Many airlines require a doctor's note that approves flying, specially at over 28 weeks. During flights, the risk of is decreased by getting up and walking occasionally, as well as by avoiding dehydration. do not use ionizing radiation, and are safe in pregnancy. Airports can also possibly use , which use a very low dose, but where safety in pregnancy is not fully established. Each year, ill health as a result of pregnancy is experienced (sometimes permanently) by more than 20 million women around the world. In 2016, complications of pregnancy resulted in 230,600 deaths down from 377,000 deaths in 1990. Common causes include (72,000), (20,000), (32,000), (10,000), and (20,000), which includes , , and . The following are some examples of pregnancy complications: , with an increased risk due to . These are the leading cause of death in pregnant women in the US. Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), a skin disease that develops around the 32nd week. Signs are red plaques, papules, and itchiness around the belly button that then spreads all over the body except for the inside of hands and face. , including , implantation of the embryo outside the uterus , excessive nausea and vomiting that is more severe than normal morning sickness. , a blood clot that forms in the legs and migrates to the lungs. is a rare complication thought to be brought about by a disruption in the metabolism of fatty acids by . There is also an increased susceptibility and severity of certain infections in pregnancy.

This is about 133 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44. About 10% to 15% of recognized pregnancies end in miscarriage. Globally, 44% of pregnancies are . Over half (56%) of unplanned pregnancies are aborted. In countries where , or only carried out in circumstances where the mother's life is at risk, 48% of unplanned pregnancies are . Compared to the rate in countries where abortion is legal, at 69%. Of pregnancies in 2012, 120 million occurred in Asia, 54 million in Africa, 19 million in Europe, 18 million in Latin America and the Caribbean, 7 million in North America, and 1 million in . Pregnancy rates are 140 per 1000 women of childbearing age in the developing world and 94 per 1000 in the developed world. The rate of pregnancy, as well as the ages at which it occurs, differ by country and region. It is influenced by a number of factors, such as cultural, social and religious norms; access to contraception; and rates of education. The (TFR) in 2013 was estimated to be highest in (7.03 children/woman) and lowest in (0.79 children/woman). In Europe, the average childbearing age has been rising continuously for some time. In Western, Northern, and Southern Europe, first-time mothers are on average 26 to 29 years old, up from 23 to 25 years at the start of the 1970s. In a number of European countries (Spain), the mean age of women at first childbirth has crossed the 30-year threshold. This process is not restricted to Europe. Asia, Japan and the United States are all seeing average age at first birth on the rise, and increasingly the process is spreading to countries in the developing world like China, Turkey and Iran. In the US, the average age of first childbirth was 25.4 in 2010. In the United States and United Kingdom, 40% of pregnancies are , and between a quarter and half of those unplanned pregnancies were . In most cultures, pregnant women have a special status in society and receive particularly gentle care. At the same time, they are subject to expectations that may exert great psychological pressure, such as having to produce a son and heir. In many traditional societies, pregnancy must be preceded by marriage, on pain of ostracism of mother and . Overall, pregnancy is accompanied by numerous customs that are often subject to ethnological research, often rooted in or religion. The is an example of a modern custom. Pregnancy is an important topic in . The prospective child may preliminarily be placed into numerous . The parents' relationship and the relation between parents and their surroundings are also affected. A may be made during pregnancy as a keepsake. Images of pregnant women, especially small , were made in traditional cultures in many places and periods, though it is rarely one of the most common types of image. These include ceramic figures from some cultures, and a few figures from most of the ancient Mediterranean cultures. Many of these seem to be connected with . Identifying whether such figures are actually meant to show pregnancy is often a problem, as well as understanding their role in the culture concerned. Among the oldest surviving examples of the depiction of pregnancy are prehistoric figurines found across much of and collectively known as . Some of these appear to be pregnant. Due to the important role of the in , the Western visual arts have a long tradition of depictions of pregnancy, especially in the biblical scene of the , and devotional images called a . The unhappy scene usually called , showing the moment of discovery of 's forbidden pregnancy, is sometimes painted from the Renaissance onwards. Gradually, portraits of pregnant women began to appear, with a particular fashion for ""pregnancy portraits"" in elite portraiture of the years around 1600. Pregnancy, and especially pregnancy of unmarried women, is also an important motif in literature. Notable examples include Hardy's and Goethe's . Anatomical model of a pregnant woman; (1639–1715); 1700; Bronze figure of a pregnant naked woman by , , second wife of , 1620 , aka 1852, , Modern reproductive medicine offers many forms of for couples who stay childless against their will, such as , , and . An abortion is the termination of an embryo or fetus, either naturally or via medical methods. When carried out by choice, it is usually within the first trimester, sometimes in the second, and rarely in the third. Not using contraception, contraceptive failure, poor family planning or rape can lead to . Legality of socially indicated abortions varies widely both internationally and through time. In most countries of Western Europe, abortions during the first trimester were a criminal offense a few decades ago but have since been legalized, sometimes subject to mandatory consultations. In Germany, for example, as of 2009 less than 3% of abortions had a medical indication. Many countries have various legal regulations in place to protect pregnant women and their children. ensures that pregnant women are exempt from activities such as night shifts or carrying heavy stocks. typically provides paid leave from work during roughly the last trimester of pregnancy and for some time after birth. Notable extreme cases include Norway (8 months with full pay) and the United States (no paid leave at all except in some states). Moreover, many countries have laws against . In the United States, some actions that result in miscarriage or stillbirth are considered crimes. One law that does so is the federal . In 2014, the American state of passed a law which allows prosecutors to charge a woman with criminal assault if she uses illegal drugs during her pregnancy and her fetus or newborn is considered harmed as a result. .

27a6eec0-fc91-4237-bbf4-a8c57fb998c9,"Post-term, postmaturity, prolonged pregnancy, post-dates pregnancy, postmature birth is when a woman has not yet delivered her baby after 42 weeks of , two weeks beyond the typical 40 week duration of pregnancy. Post-mature births carry risks for both the mother and the baby, including fetal malnutrition, , and . After the 42nd week of gestation, the , which supplies the baby with nutrients and oxygen from the mother, starts aging and will eventually fail. Postterm pregnancy is a reason to induce labor. The management of labor and delivery may vary depending on the gestational age. It is common to encounter the following terms when describing different time periods of pregnancy. Postterm - ≥ 42 weeks + 0 days of gestation (≥ 294 days from the first day of last menstrual period, or ≥ 14 days from the estimated due date) Late term - 41 weeks + 0 days to 41 weeks + 6 days of gestation Full term - 39 weeks + 0 days to 40 weeks + 6 days of gestation Early term - 37 weeks + 0 days to 38 weeks + 6 days of gestation Besides postterm pregnancy, other terminologies have been used to describe the same condition (≥ 42w+0d), such as prolonged pregnancy, postdates, and postdatism. However, these terminologies are less commonly used to avoid confusion. Postterm pregnancy should not be confused with postmaturity, postmaturity syndrome, or dysmaturity. These terms describe the neonatal condition that may be caused by postterm pregnancy instead of the duration of pregnancy. Because postterm pregnancy is a condition solely based on gestational age, there are no confirming physical signs or symptoms. While it is difficult to determine gestational age physically, infants that are born postterm may be associated with a physical condition called . The most common symptoms for this condition are dry skin, overgrown nails, creases on the baby's palms and soles of their feet, minimal fat, abundant hair on their head, and either a brown, green, or yellow discoloration of their skin. Doctors diagnose postmature birth based on the baby's physical appearance and the length of the mother's pregnancy. However, some postmature babies may show no or few signs of postmaturity. Reduced —Once a pregnancy has surpassed the 40-week gestation period, doctors closely monitor the mother for signs of placental deterioration. Toward the end of pregnancy, is deposited on the walls of blood vessels, and proteins are deposited on the surface of the , which changes the placenta. This limits the blood flow through the placenta and ultimately leads to , and the baby is no longer properly nourished. Induced labor is strongly encouraged if this happens. —Low volume of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. It is associated with complications such as cord compression, abnormal heart rate, fetal acidosis, and meconium amniotic fluid. —Respiratory compromise secondary to meconium present in infant's lungs. —Estimated fetal weight of ≥ 4.5 kg. It can further increase the risk of and . —Difficulty in delivering the shoulders due to increased body size. Increased assisted or assisted birth—When postterm babies are larger than average, forceps or vacuum delivery may be used to resolve the difficulties at the delivery time, such as shoulder dystocia. Complications include lacerations, skin markings, external eye trauma, intracranial injury, facial nerve injury, skull fracture, and rarely death. Increased —Induction may be needed if labor progression is abnormal. Oxytocin, a medication used in induction, may have side effects such as low blood pressure. Increased forceps assisted or vacuum assisted birth—operative vaginal deliveries increase maternal risks of genital trauma. Increased birth—Postterm babies may be larger than an average baby, thus increasing the length of labor. The labor is increased because the baby's head is too big to pass through the mother's pelvis. This is called . Caesarean sections are encouraged if this happens. Complications include bleeding, infection, abnormal wound healing, abnormal placenta in future pregnancies, and rarely death. A 2019 randomized control trial of induced labor at 42 or 43 weeks was terminated early due to statistical evidence of ""significantly increased risk for women induced at the start of week 43"". The study implies clinical guidelines for induction of labor no later than at 41 gestational weeks. The causes of post-term births are unknown, but post-mature births are more likely when the mother has experienced a previous post-mature birth. Due dates are easily miscalculated when the mother is unsure of her last menstrual period. When there is a miscalculation, the baby could be delivered before or after the expected due date. Post-mature births can also be attributed to irregular menstrual cycles. When the menstrual period is irregular it is very difficult to judge when the ovaries would be available for fertilization and subsequent pregnancy. Some post-mature pregnancies may not be post-mature in reality due to the uncertainty of mother's last menstrual period. However, in most countries where gestation is measured by ultrasound scan technology, this is less likely. Once a pregnancy is diagnosed postterm, usually at or greater than 42 weeks of , the mother should be offered additional monitoring as this can provide valuable clues that the fetal health is being maintained. Regular movements of the fetus is the best sign indicating that it is still in good health. The mother should keep a ""kick-chart"" to record the movements of her fetus. If there is a reduction in the number of movements it could indicate placental deterioration. Doppler fetal monitor is a hand-held device that is routinely used in prenatal care. When it is used correctly, it can quickly measure the fetal heart rate. The baseline of fetal heart rate is typically between 110 and 160 beats per minute. Doppler flow study is a type of ultrasound that measures the amount of blood flowing in and out of the placenta. The ultrasound machine can also detect the direction of blood flow and display it in red or blue. Usually, a red color indicates a flow toward the ultrasound transducer, while blue indicates a flow away from the transducer. Based on the display, doctors can evaluate blood flow to the umbilical arteries, umbilical veins, or other organs such as heart and brain. (NST) is a type of electronic fetal monitoring that uses a to monitor fetal heartbeat, fetal movement and mother's contraction. NST is typically monitored for at least 20 minutes. Signs of a reactive (normal) NST include a baseline fetal heart rate (FHR) between 110 and 160 beats per minute (bpm) and 2 accelerations of FHR of at least 15 bpm above baseline for over 15 seconds. and longer monitoring may be needed if NST is non-reactive. A is a noninvasive procedure that uses the ultrasound to evaluate the fetal health based on NST and four ultrasound parameters: fetal movement, fetal breathing, fetal muscle tone, and the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus. A score of 2 points is given for each category that meets the criteria or 0 points if the criteria is not met (no 1 point). Sometimes, the NST is omitted, making the highest score 8/8 instead of 10/10. Generally, a score of 8/10 or 10/10 is considered a normal test result, unless 0 points is given for amniotic fluid. A score of 6/10 with normal amniotic fluid is considered equivocal, and a repeated test within 24 hours may be needed. A score of 4/10 or less is considered abnormal, and delivery may be indicated. Low amniotic fluid can cause pinching umbilical cord, decreasing blood flow to the fetus. Therefore, a score of 0 points for amniotic fluid may indicate the fetus is at risk. A woman who has reached 42 weeks of pregnancy is likely to be offered induction of labour. Alternatively, she can choose expectant management, that is, she waits for the natural onset of labour. Women opting for expectant management may also choose to carry on with additional monitoring of their baby, with regular CTG, ultrasound, and biophysical profile. Risks of expectant management vary between studies. Inducing labor artificially starts the labor process by using medication and other techniques. Labor is usually only induced if there is potential danger on the mother or child. There are several reasons for labor induction; the mother's water breaks, and contractions have not started, the child is post-mature, the mother has diabetes or high blood pressure, or there is not enough amniotic fluid around the baby. Labor induction is not always the best choice because it has its own risks. Sometimes mothers will request to be induced for reasons that are not medical. This is called an elective induction. Doctors try to avoid inducing labor unless it is completely necessary. There are four common methods of starting contractions. The four most common are stripping the membranes, breaking the mother's water, giving the hormone , and giving the synthetic hormone . Stripping the membranes doesn't work for all women, but can for most. A doctor inserts a finger into the mother's cervix and moves it around to separate the membrane connecting the amniotic sac, which houses the baby, from the walls of the uterus. Once this membrane is stripped, the hormone prostaglandin is naturally released into the mother's body and initiates contractions. Most of the time doing this only once will not immediately start labor. It may have to be done several times before the stimulant hormone is released, and contractions start. The next method is breaking the mother's water, which is also referred to as an amniotomy. The doctor uses a plastic hook to break the membrane and rupture the amniotic sac. Within a few hours labor usually begins. Giving the hormone prostaglandin ripens the cervix, meaning the cervix softens, thins out, or dilates. The drug Cervidil is administered by mouth in tablet form or in gel form as an insert. This is most often done in the hospital overnight. The hormone oxytocin is usually given in the synthetic form of Pitocin. It is administered through an IV throughout the labor process. This hormone stimulates contractions. Pitocin is also used to ""restart"" labor when it's lagging. The use of misoprostol is also allowed, but close monitoring of the mother is required. Stripping the membranes: Stripping the membranes only takes a few minutes and causes a few intense cramps. Many women report a feeling similar to urination, others report it to be quite painful. Breaking the water: Having one's water broken feels like a slight tug and then a warm flow of liquid. Pitocin: When the synthetic hormone, pitocin, is used, contractions occur more frequently than a natural occurring birth; they are also more intense. Prevalence of postterm pregnancy may vary between countries due to different population characteristics or medical management. Factors include number of first-time pregnancies, genetic predisposition, timing of ultrasound assessment, and Caesarian section rates, etc. The incidence is approximately 7%. Postterm pregnancy occurs in 0.4% of pregnancies approximately in the United States according to birth certificate data. Kendig, James W (March 2007). . .

Although the majority of pregnancies are uneventful, sometimes complications do happen. The following are some of the more common pregnancy complications. Too much or too little amniotic fluid in the sac around the fetus may be a sign of a problem with the pregnancy. Too much fluid can put too much pressure on the mother's uterus, leading to preterm labor. It also can cause pressure on the mother's diaphragm. This can lead to breathing difficulties. Fluids tend to build up in cases of uncontrolled diabetes, a multiple pregnancy, incompatible blood types, or birth defects. Too little fluid may be a sign of birth defects, growth retardation, or stillbirth. Bleeding in late pregnancy may be a sign of placental complications, a vaginal or cervical infection, or preterm labor. Women who bleed in late pregnancy may be at greater risk of losing the fetus and bleeding excessively. Bleeding at any time during the pregnancy should be reported to your healthcare provider right away. An ectopic pregnancy is the development of the fetus outside of the uterus. This can happen in the fallopian tubes, cervical canal, or the pelvic or belly. The cause of an ectopic pregnancy is usually scar tissue in the fallopian tube from infection or disease. The risk of ectopic pregnancy is increased in women who have had tubal sterilization procedures, especially women who were younger than age 30 at the time of sterilization. Ectopic pregnancies happen in about 1 out of 50 pregnancies and can be very dangerous to the mother. Symptoms may include spotting and cramping. The longer an ectopic pregnancy goes on, the greater the chance that a fallopian tube will rupture. An ultrasound and blood tests may confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of an ectopic pregnancy may include medicine or surgical removal of the fetus. A miscarriage is pregnancy loss that happens up to 20 weeks of gestation. Most miscarriages happen before 12 weeks. Miscarriages happen in about 15% of all pregnancies and are usually due to genetic or chromosomal abnormalities. Miscarriages are usually preceded by spotting and intense cramping. To confirm a miscarriage, an ultrasound and blood tests may be done. The fetus and contents of the uterus are often naturally expelled. If this does not happen, a procedure called a dilation and curettage (D & C) may be necessary. This procedure uses special instruments to remove the abnormal pregnancy. Fetal loss in the second trimester may happen if the cervix is weak and opens too early. This is called incompetent cervix. In some cases of incompetent cervix, a healthcare provider can help prevent pregnancy loss by stitching the cervix closed until delivery. Under normal circumstances, the placenta attaches to the uterine wall. However, two types of placental complications may happen, including: Sometimes the placenta becomes detached from the uterine wall too soon. This is called placental abruption and leads to bleeding and less oxygen and nutrients to the fetus. The detachment may be complete or partial. The cause of placental abruption is often unknown. Placental abruption happens in about 1 in every 100 live births. Placental abruption is more common in women who smoke, have high blood pressure, and/or have a multiple pregnancy. It also happens in women who have had previous children or a history of placental abruption. Symptoms and treatment of placental abruption depend on the degree of detachment. Symptoms may include bleeding, cramping, and belly tenderness. Diagnosis is usually confirmed by doing a complete physical exam and an ultrasound. Women are usually put in the hospital for this condition. They may have to deliver the baby early. Normally, the placenta is located in the upper part of the uterus. Placenta previa is a condition in which the placenta is attached close to or covering the cervix (the opening into the uterus). This type of placental complication happens in about 1 in every 200 deliveries and happens more often in women who have scarring of the uterus from previous pregnancies. It also happens in women who have fibroids or other problems in the uterus, or in women who have had previous uterine surgeries. Symptoms may include vaginal bleeding that is bright red and not associated with belly tenderness or pain. Diagnosis is confirmed by doing a physical exam and an ultrasound. Depending on how bad the problem is and the stage of pregnancy, a change in activities or bed rest may be ordered. The baby usually has to be delivered by cesarean section to keep the placenta from detaching early and depriving the baby of oxygen during delivery. Preeclampsia, formerly called toxemia, is characterized by pregnancy-induced high blood pressure. It is accompanied by protein in the urine. Sometimes swelling due to fluid retention is also present. Eclampsia is the more severe form of this problem. This can lead to seizures, coma, or even death. The cause of preeclampsia is unknown, but it is more common in first pregnancies. It affects about 5% to 8% of all pregnant women. Other risk factors for preeclampsia include: A woman with high blood pressure, diabetes, and/or kidney disease before she became pregnant Symptoms may include severe swelling of the hands and face, high blood pressure, headache, dizziness, irritability, decreased urine output, belly pain, and blurred vision. Treatment will vary according to the severity of the condition and the stage of the pregnancy. Treatment may include hospitalization, bed rest, medicine to lower blood pressure, and close monitoring of both the fetus and the mother.",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-0.0884983018040657,4

It slows or stops the normal flow of bile from the gallbladder. This causes itching and yellowing of your skin, eyes, and mucous membranes (jaundice). Cholestasis sometimes starts in early pregnancy. But it is more common in the second and third trimesters. It most often goes away within a few days after delivery. The high levels of bile may cause serious problems for your developing baby (fetus). Doctors don't know what causes cholestasis of pregnancy. They do know that this happens: Your liver makes bile. Bile helps break down fats during digestion. The hormones your body releases during pregnancy change the way the gallbladder works. This may cause bile to slow or stop flowing. Bile builds up in the liver and spills into the bloodstream. What are the symptoms of cholestasis of pregnancy? The main symptom of cholestasis of pregnancy is severe itching. This is sometimes called pruritus. It may be all over the body. But it is more common on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It may also be worse at night. Other symptoms may include: Pain in the belly (abdomen), although this is not common Yellow color of skin, eyes, and mucous membranes (jaundice), although this is not common The symptoms of cholestasis sometimes look like other health conditions. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Your healthcare provider is likely to think you have cholestasis of pregnancy if you have severe itching. Lab tests will help to confirm the diagnosis. You may have these tests: Liver function tests, including the amount of bile acid in the blood. This test result is high in cholestasis of pregnancy. Other lab tests, including prothrombin time. This checks how well your blood clots. You may also have other tests such as an ultrasound exam of the tubes that carry bile (bile ducts).  Your healthcare provider will figure out the best treatment for you based on: How well you can handle certain medicines, procedures, or therapies The goals of treating cholestasis of pregnancy are to relieve the itching and prevent complications. Treatment may include: To help relieve itching and help lower the level of bile.   The level of bile in your blood may be checked. This helps your healthcare provider figure out treatment. The healthcare provider may check your developing baby for any problems. You may deliver your baby early, between 37 to 38 weeks of pregnancy. This will lessen the risk to your baby. This may be by vaginal delivery with medicine to start labor. Or you may have a cesarean delivery. Your healthcare provider may decide that you should deliver even earlier, depending on your symptoms, test results, and pregnancy history. What are the complications of cholestasis of pregnancy? There is a serious risk of complications in your developing baby if you have cholestasis of pregnancy. The complications include: This means your developing baby is not doing well. For example, the baby may not be getting enough oxygen. You may be at greater risk for giving birth too early. This means your baby has a bowel movement before birth. This may cause very serious breathing problems. Your baby may have breathing problems as a newborn. Cholestasis of pregnancy can also lead to vitamin K deficiency. This will need to be treated before you give birth, because it can cause you to bleed too much. Yellow coloring of your eyes, skin, or mucous membranes (jaundice) Cholestasis of pregnancy is a condition that slows or stops the normal flow of bile in the gallbladder. It can cause severe itching. This is the most common symptom. The goals of treating cholestasis of pregnancy are to relieve itching and prevent complications for your developing baby. Babies of women with cholestasis are often delivered early (usually around 37 weeks) because of the risks. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider: Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-10.871480941772461,135

First trimester screening is a combination of fetal ultrasound and maternal blood testing. It can help find out the risk that the fetus has certain birth defects. Screening tests may be used alone or with other tests. Ultrasound test for fetal nuchal translucency (NT) Nuchal translucency screening uses an ultrasound test to check the area at the back of the fetal neck for extra fluid or thickening. These tests measure 2 substances found in the blood of all pregnant women:  Pregnancy-associated plasma protein screening (PAPP-A). This is a protein made by the placenta in early pregnancy. Abnormal levels are linked to a higher risk for chromosome problems. This is a hormone made by the placenta in early pregnancy. Abnormal levels are linked to a higher risk for chromosome problems. When used together, these tests have a greater ability to find out if the fetus might have a genetic birth defect such as Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and trisomy 18. If the results of these tests are abnormal, your healthcare provider will suggest genetic counseling. You may need more testing. That may include chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, cell-free fetal DNA, or other ultrasounds. Second trimester prenatal screening may include several blood tests. These are called multiple markers. They give information about a woman's risk of having a baby with certain genetic conditions or birth defects. Screening is often done by taking a sample of your blood between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy. The 16th to 18th is ideal. The multiple markers are listed below. This blood test measures the level of alpha-fetoprotein in your blood during pregnancy. AFP is a protein normally made by the fetal liver. It is in the fluid around the fetus (amniotic fluid) and crosses the placenta into your blood. The AFP blood test is also called MSAFP (maternal serum AFP).Abnormal levels of AFP may be a sign of: Open neural tube defects (ONTD) such as spina bifida An incorrect due date. The levels of AFP vary throughout pregnancy. This is human chorionic gonadotropin hormone. It is made by the placenta. Abnormal results of AFP and other markers may mean you need more testing. An ultrasound is often done to confirm the dates of the pregnancy. It also looks at the fetal spine and other body parts for problems. You may need an amniocentesis for accurate diagnosis. Multiple marker screening is not diagnostic. This means it is not 100% accurate. It is only a screening test to find out who should be offered more testing for their pregnancy. The tests show false-positive results. This means they show a problem when the fetus is actually healthy. Or the results may be false negative. This means they show that the fetus is normal when the fetus actually does have a health problem. Having both first and second trimester screening tests done makes it more likely to find a problem if there is one than using just one screening alone. As many as 19 out of 20 cases of Down syndrome can be found when both first and second trimester screening are used. An amniocentesis is a test that takes a small sample of the amniotic fluid. It is done to diagnose chromosome problems and open neural tube defects (ONTDs) such as spina bifida. The test can also look for other genetic problems and disorders if you have a family history of them. These other results also depend on the lab doing the testing. An amniocentesis is generally offered to women between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy who are at higher risk for chromosome problems. This includes women who have had an abnormal maternal blood screening test. The test may have indicated a higher risk for a chromosome problem or neural tube defect. An amniocentesis involves putting a long, thin needle through your abdomen into the amniotic sac. The healthcare provider withdraws a small sample of the amniotic fluid. The amniotic fluid has cells shed by the fetus,. These cells have genetic information. The specific details of each test vary slightly, but an amniocentesis often follows this process: The healthcare team cleans your belly (abdomen) with an antiseptic. The healthcare provider may use a local anesthetic to numb the skin. The provider uses ultrasound to help guide a hollow needle into the amniotic sac. The provider withdraws a small sample of fluid to be sent to a lab. After the test, don't do any strenuous activity for 24 hours. You may feel some cramping during or after the amniocentesis. If you are carrying twins or other multiples, you will need sampling from each amniotic sac to study each baby.  The fluid sample is sent to a genetics lab so that the cells can grow and be tested. AFP is also measured to rule out an open neural tube defect such as spina bifida. AFP is a protein made by the fetus and is in the fluid. Results are often available in 10 days to 2 weeks, depending on the lab. Discuss the risks of this procedure with your healthcare provider. Sometimes the amniocentesis can't be done. It depends on the position of the baby, the placenta, the amount of fluid, and your anatomy. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a prenatal test. It involves taking a sample of some of the placental tissue. This tissue often has the same genetic material as the fetus. It can be tested for chromosome problems and some other genetic problems. The test can also look for other genetic problems and disorders if you have a family history of them. These other results also depend on the lab doing the testing. Unlike amniocentesis, CVS does not give information on neural tube defects such as spina bifida. For this reason, women who have CVS also need a follow-up blood test between 16 and 18 weeks of their pregnancy to screen for neural tube defects. CVS may be offered if you are at higher risk for chromosome problems. You may also be offered it if you have a family history of a genetic problem that is testable from the placental tissue. CVS is usually done between the 10th and 13th weeks of pregnancy. The exact method for CVS an vary, but the procedure involves putting a small tube (catheter) through your vagina and into your cervix. It usually follows this process: The healthcare provider uses ultrasound to guide the catheter into place near the placenta. The provider removes tissue using a syringe on the other end of the catheter. For a transabdominal CVS, the provider puts a needle through your abdomen and into the uterus to take a sample of cells from the placenta. You may feel some cramping during and after the CVS procedure. If you are carrying twins or other multiples, you often will need sampling from each placenta. But CVS is not always advised for multiples because the procedure is complicated and the placentas may not be in a good position to get a sample. The tissue samples are sent to a genetic lab to grow and be tested. Results are often available in 10 days to 2 weeks, depending on the lab. Some women may not be candidates for CVS, or they may not get results that are 100% accurate,. They may need a follow-up amniocentesis. In some cases an active vaginal infection such as herpes or gonorrhea will prohibit the procedure. Other times the healthcare provider takes a sample that does not have enough tissue to grow in the lab. That may cause incomplete or inconclusive results. Discuss the risks of CVS with your healthcare provider. During late pregnancy and during labor, your healthcare provider may want to watch the fetal heart rate and other functions. Fetal heart rate monitoring is a way of checking the rate and rhythm of the fetal heartbeat. The average fetal heart rate is between 110 and 160 beats per minute. It may change as the fetus responds to conditions in the uterus. An abnormal fetal heart rate or pattern may mean that the fetus is not getting enough oxygen or there are other problems. It also may mean that an emergency or cesarean delivery is needed. The most basic type of fetal heart rate monitor is to use a type of stethoscope called a fetoscope. Another type of monitoring is with a hand-held Doppler device. This is often used during prenatal visits to count the fetal heart rate. During labor, continuous electronic fetal monitoring is often used. The specific details may vary slightly, but electronic fetal monitoring often follows this process: The healthcare provider puts gel on your abdomen to help the ultrasound transducer work properly. The provider attaches the ultrasound transducer to the abdomen with straps and sends the fetal heartbeat to a recorder. The fetal heart rate is displayed on a screen and may be printed onto special paper. During contractions, a monitoring device (external tocodynamometer) is placed over the top of the uterus with a belt. This device can record the patterns of contractions. Sometimes, internal fetal monitoring is needed for a more accurate reading of the fetal heart rate. This monitoring can be done when birth is close. Your amniotic sac must be broken and your cervix must be partially dilated to do it. Internal fetal monitoring involves putting an electrode through the dilated cervix. The electrode is attached to the scalp of the fetus. What are a glucose challenge and a glucose tolerance tests? The first 1-hour test is a glucose challenge test. If the results are abnormal, a glucose tolerance test is done. A glucose tolerance test is often done in weeks 24 to 28 of pregnancy. It measures levels of sugar (glucose) in your blood. Abnormal glucose levels may be a sign of gestational diabetes. The glucose tolerance test is done if you have an elevated 1-hour glucose challenge test. The specific details may vary slightly, but a glucose tolerance test often follows this process: You may be asked to drink only water on the day you get the test. The healthcare provider will draw a fasting sample of blood from a vein. You will be given a special glucose solution to drink. The provider will draw blood several times over several hours to measure the glucose levels in your body. Group B streptococcus (GBS) are bacteria found in the lower genital tract of about 1 in 4 women. GBS infection often causes no problems in women before pregnancy. But it can cause serious illness in the mother during pregnancy. GBS may cause chorioamnionitis. This is a severe infection of the placental tissues. It can also cause postpartum infection. Urinary tract infections caused by GBS can lead to preterm labor and birth, or pyelonephritis and sepsis. GBS is the most common cause of life-threatening infections in newborns, including pneumonia and meningitis. Newborn babies get the infection during pregnancy or from the mother's genital tract during labor and birth. The CDC advises that all pregnant women be screened for vaginal and rectal group B strep between 35 to 37 weeks gestation. If you have certain risk factors or a positive result, you should be treated with antibiotics. This will lower the risk of passing GBS to your baby. Babies whose mothers get antibiotics for a positive GBS test are 20 times less likely to develop the disease than those whose mothers don't get treatment. An ultrasound scan is a test that uses high-frequency sound waves to make pictures of the internal organs. A screening ultrasound is sometimes done during a pregnancy to check normal fetal growth and make sure of the due date. Ultrasounds may be done at various times throughout pregnancy for many reasons. To find out the due date. This is the most accurate way of finding the due date. To find out the number of fetuses and see the placentas Mid-trimester (sometimes called the 18- to 20-week scan) To confirm the due date. A due date set in the first trimester is rarely changed. To find out the number of fetuses and look at the placentas To help with prenatal tests such as an amniocentesis To look at the fetal anatomy to see if there are any problems The specific details may vary slightly, but ultrasounds often follow the same process. Two types of ultrasounds can be done during pregnancy: In an abdominal ultrasound, the healthcare provider puts gel on your abdomen. The ultrasound transducer glides over the gel to create the image. In a transvaginal ultrasound, the provider uses a smaller ultrasound transducer. He or she puts the transducer into the vagina and rests it against the back of the vagina to create an image. A transvaginal ultrasound makes a sharper image. It is often used in early pregnancy. There are several types of ultrasound imaging techniques. The most common is 2D. This gives a flat picture of one aspect of the image. If more information is needed, a 3D ultrasound exam can be done. This technique gives a 3D picture. It requires a special machine and special training. But the 3D image lets the healthcare provider to see width, height, and depth of images. These can be helpful in diagnosis. The 3D images can also be saved for later review. The latest technology is 4D ultrasound. It lets the healthcare provider see the fetus moving in real time. With 4D imaging, a 3D image is continuously updated. This makes a ""live action"" view. These images often have a golden color that helps show shadows and highlights. Ultrasound images may be captured in still photographs or on video to document findings. Ultrasounds are constantly being improved and refined. As with any test, results may not be completely accurate. But ultrasound can give valuable information for parents and healthcare providers to help manage and care for the pregnancy and fetus. Ultrasound also gives parents a special chance to see their baby before birth. This helps them to bond and establish an early relationship. Fetal ultrasound has no known risks other than mild discomfort. This is because of pressure from the transducer on the abdomen or in the vagina. No radiation is used during the procedure. Transvaginal ultrasound requires that the ultrasound transducer be covered in a plastic or latex sheath. This may cause a reaction in women with a latex allergy. Fetal ultrasound is sometimes offered in nonmedical settings to give keepsake images or videos for parents. The ultrasound procedure itself is considered safe, but it's possible that untrained workers may give parents false assurances about their baby's well-being. Or perhaps a problem may be missed. Having ultrasound done by trained medical staff who can correctly understand findings is recommended. Talk with your healthcare provider or midwife if you have questions. Many genetic problems can be diagnosed before birth. Your healthcare provider or midwife may advise genetic testing during the pregnancy if you or your partner have a family history of genetic disorders or you have had a fetus or baby with a genetic problem. Examples of genetic disorders that are commonly screened for include: We support each delivery with nurturing care and outstanding comfort.",98,most common complications in pregnancy,-11.611665725708008,156

High blood pressure, or , is defined as blood pressure greater than or equal to 130/80 mm Hg. The condition is a serious concern for some pregnant women. When it’s well-managed, high blood pressure during pregnancy isn’t always dangerous. But it can sometimes cause severe health complications for both mother and developing baby. The estimates that around six to eight percent of pregnant women between the ages of 20 and 44 in the United States have this condition. There are several possible causes of high blood pressure during pregnancy. a family history of pregnancy-related hypertension assistive reproductive technology (such as in vitro fertilization, or ) Risk factors for high blood pressure during pregnancy There are a few risk factors that could make high blood pressure more likely during pregnancy. Unhealthy lifestyle choices may lead to high blood pressure during pregnancy. Being overweight or obese, or not staying active are major risk factors for high blood pressure. Women experiencing their first pregnancy are more likely to have high blood pressure. Fortunately, there’s a lower chance of this condition in subsequent pregnancies. Carrying can make it more likely for a woman to develop hypertension, because the body is working harder to nourish more than one baby. According to the , using assistive technologies (such as IVF) during the conception process can increase chances of high blood pressure in a pregnant woman. Age can also be a factor. Pregnant women over the age of 35 are at higher risk. Women who had high blood pressure before pregnancy are at higher risk for related complications during pregnancy than those with normal blood pressure. Types of pregnancy-related blood pressure conditions High blood pressure during pregnancy can be divided into three different conditions. Sometimes a woman has preexisting high blood pressure, or hypertension, before she gets pregnant. This may be referred to as chronic hypertension, and is usually treated with blood pressure . Doctors also consider hypertension that occurs in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy to be chronic hypertension. develops after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually resolves after delivery. When diagnosed before 30 weeks, there’s a higher chance it will progress to (see below). Chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia Women who have chronic hypertension before becoming pregnant can develop preeclampsia. This occurs when they experience protein in their urine or additional complications as the pregnancy progresses. A blood pressure reading is a fraction: your systolic blood pressure over your diastolic blood pressure. The top number is your , which is a measurement of the pressure on your arteries when the heart is beating or squeezing blood forward through your body. The pressure, or the lower number, is a measurement of the blood pressure in your arteries when the heart is at rest. What is considered normal blood pressure during pregnancy? To determine what your “normal” blood pressure is during pregnancy, your doctor will likely take a baseline blood pressure measurement at your first visit. Then they will measure your blood pressure at every visit that follows. Normal blood pressure is anything less than 120/80 mm Hg. What is considered high blood pressure during pregnancy? A blood pressure that is greater than 130/90 mm Hg or that is 15 degrees higher on the top number from where you started before pregnancy may be cause for concern. High blood pressure during pregnancy is defined as 140 mm Hg or higher systolic, with diastolic 90 mm Hg or higher. Early in pregnancy, usually from 5 weeks to the middle of the , a pregnant woman’s blood pressure may actually decrease. This is because pregnancy hormones can stimulate blood vessels to widen. As a result, the resistance to blood flow isn’t as high. What is considered low blood pressure during pregnancy? While there isn’t a definitive number that is too low, there are symptoms that are associated with low blood pressure: As a woman progresses in her pregnancy, her blood pressure may change or return to pre-pregnancy levels. There are a few possible reasons for this. According to the journal , a woman’s blood volume increases by as much as 45 percent during pregnancy. This is extra blood that the heart must pump throughout the body. (left side of the heart that does a significant amount of pumping) becomes thicker and larger. This temporary effect allows the heart to work harder to support the increased blood volume. The release increased amounts of vasopressin, a hormone that leads to increased water retention. In most cases, high blood pressure during pregnancy will decrease after the baby is delivered. In cases where blood pressure remains elevated, your doctor may prescribe medication to get it back to normal. There are ways to track your blood pressure between doctor visits. You can buy a from a pharmacy or online medical goods store. Many of these devices will go on your wrist or upper arm. To check the monitor’s accuracy, take it to your doctor’s office and compare the readings on the monitor to those from your doctor. Visit a grocery store, pharmacy, or other store that has a machine that takes blood pressure readings. For the most accurate readings, take your blood pressure at the same time every day. Take it while seated with your legs uncrossed. Use the same arm each time. Notify your doctor immediately if you have repeated high blood pressure readings that are four hours apart or symptoms of high blood pressure. What are the complications of high blood pressure during pregnancy? If you have high blood pressure during pregnancy, there can be complications. This condition can cause serious damage to your organs, including your brain and kidneys. Preeclampsia is also known as toxemia. Preeclampsia with seizures becomes .

Dietary guidelines for pregnant women vary from person to person. A nutritionist can help create a meal plan that’s designed for your specific height and weight. Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol.

c5c61fe9-6a53-4060-819e-fc225a82bcde,"Everything You Need to Know About Cholestasis of Pregnancy — Cholestasis is a condition that can develop in your liver during the latter part of your pregnancy. You may also hear it referred to as intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). It causes intense itching, and it can make your skin and eyes appear yellow. Those might not sound so serious, but unfortunately, untreated or poorly managed cholestasis can also lead to serious complications for both you and your unborn baby. Cholestasis of pregnancy is actually a fairly common condition. It affects pregnancies in the United States. But unless you’ve had it before, you might not know very much about it at all. The biggest (and most annoying) symptom of cholestasis is the itching. Oh, the itching! In fact, most people who eventually get diagnosed with cholestasis know that something’s wrong because they’re itching so much without a clear reason why. You might be a little confused, since there’s no rash associated with this condition. You may notice that your hands are itchy, or maybe your feet — or both. Then the itch begins to spread to other parts of your body. It typically develops in the third trimester, but it’s possible for it to start earlier. Beyond the itching, there are other possible symptoms that you might also develop if you have cholestasis during pregnancy: Not everyone with cholestasis will have the exact same symptoms, and it can range from a mild case to a severe case. The exact cause isn’t really known. There does seem to be a genetic component, to some degree. And it looks like you can probably blame your liver, and you can also blame those pregnancy hormones. When you’re pregnant, your estrogen levels rise. That increase can slow down the flow of bile from your liver to your gallbladder. (Bile is a substance that your liver produces to help your body break down fats.) Unfortunately, when this normal process is disrupted, bile tends to build up in your liver. Some of the bile salts wind up entering your bloodstream. As a result, you may develop some of those symptoms like dark-colored urine and jaundice (some yellowing of your skin, eyes and mucous membranes). And yes, you’ll very likely begin feeling the itch. Your doctor may assess you to see if you have any existing risk factors, just in case you need to keep watch for any developing symptoms. How do you know if you’re at risk for developing cholestasis of pregnancy? Ask your mom. If you have a family history of this condition, you may be at increased risk for developing it yourself. Your own history matters, too. If you’ve ever experienced cholestasis yourself during a previous pregnancy, you’re at significantly greater risk. You’re also more likely to develop cholestasis of pregnancy if you have: a history of being pregnant with two babies or more at once The points out that Latina women in the United States have a higher prevalence of cholestasis. Rates are higher in Scandinavia and South America, specifically Chile. If you start itching and have no idea what’s causing it, notify your doctor. You’ll probably need to visit your doctor and roll up your sleeve, as a physical exam and some blood work will be next on the agenda. Blood tests are necessary to gauge your liver function and measure the level of bile salts (or bile acids) in your blood. Your doctor might also be interested in checking how well your blood clots. That’s because people with cholestasis sometimes have trouble absorbing fat, and that can lead to lower levels of vitamin K. If , your body will also have trouble making the proteins that help your blood clot. That can put you at risk for excessive bleeding. Ideally, you want to eliminate that itching that’s driving you nuts, while also minimizing or eliminating any possible complications that could harm your unborn baby. Your doctor is likely to prescribe a medication known as ursodeoxycholic acid (such as UDCA, Actigall, or Ursodiol) that will reduce the levels of bile salts in your bloodstream. This should relieve the itching. Your doctor will probably want to continue monitoring you for the duration of your pregnancy to make sure the levels are staying low enough. What you can do at home for cholestasis of pregnancy Even if you and your doctor agree that you would benefit from taking medication, you might also want to embrace some lifestyle changes. For example, consider your wardrobe. Forego the tight-fitting fabrics and wear soft, loose clothing that won’t aggravate your sensitive, itchy skin instead. Another strategy to try: a warm bath. Soaking in a tub can already feel pretty great when you’re feeling heavy and bloated, but a lukewarm bath can also relieve some of the itch. Add a little oatmeal for its soothing qualities. Your doctor might also recommend some over-the-counter anti-itch medications. If you’re wondering, “What’s the big deal about some itching?” consider this: Cholestasis of pregnancy does pose some risk to your baby, both before and after birth. Possible serious complications of untreated cholestasis can include: breathing problems from inhaling meconium in the amniotic fluid You may also have trouble with excessive bleeding or hemorrhaging, as a result of a vitamin K deficiency that can develop. that more serious cases of cholestasis are more likely to have more serious complications. Sometimes the medication works just fine, and your pregnancy can proceed as usual. But in certain cases, your doctor may discuss the possibility of delivering your baby a little ahead of schedule. Given that your baby’s health may be at risk, some doctors prefer to go with an early . Your doctor will want to assess your symptoms and your blood work, as well as your baby’s development, before making a recommendation. Future risk if you’ve had cholestasis of pregnancy before If you’ve ever had cholestasis with a previous pregnancy, you’re at risk for developing it again with a future pregnancy. In fact, some estimate that between will experience it again if they get pregnant. The likelihood of a recurrence during a future pregnancy could rise as high as for women who’ve had a severe case of cholestasis during pregnancy. The good news is if you’ve had it before, you’re equipped with that knowledge. Your healthcare team can monitor your liver function and the level of bile acids or bile salts in your bloodstream from the get-go. Typically, cholestasis goes away once you’ve given birth to your baby. Your bile acid levels will drop back down to normal levels, and the itching will cease. Your doctor will give you the sign to stop taking your medication if you’ve been taking ursodeoxycholic acid to keep those bile levels in check. Your life will return to normal — well, except for that adorable brand-new little person you’re now in charge of caring for. And if you decide to have another baby later on, be sure your doctor knows about your history of cholestasis of pregnancy, so you can be monitored for it. — 13 Home Remedies for Swollen Feet During Pregnancy Several factors can increase a woman’s risk of experiencing complications during pregnancy.

1710bf3f-5e8c-4deb-bb71-7254b1a347b7,"— Most pregnancies occur without complications. However, some women who are pregnant will experience complications that can involve their health, their baby’s health, or both. Sometimes, diseases or conditions the mother had before she became pregnant can lead to complications during pregnancy. Some complications occur during delivery. Even with complications, early detection and prenatal care can reduce any further risk to you and your baby. Some of the most common complications of pregnancy include: If you already have a chronic condition or illness, talk to your doctor about how to minimize any complications before you get pregnant. If you’re already pregnant, your doctor may need to monitor your pregnancy. Some examples of common diseases and conditions that can cause complications during your pregnancy include: Other factors that may increase your risk for complications include: having a history of pregnancy loss or preterm birth What are the most common pregnancy and labor complications? The normal symptoms of pregnancy and the symptoms of complications are sometimes hard to distinguish. Although many problems are mild and don’t progress, you should always contact your doctor if you have any concerns during your pregnancy. Most pregnancy complications are manageable with prompt treatment. These are the most common complications women experience during pregnancy: High blood pressure occurs when the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the organs and the placenta are narrowed. High blood pressure is associated with a higher risk of many other complications, like preeclampsia. It puts you at a higher risk of having a baby well before your due date. This is called preterm delivery. It also increases your risk of having a baby who’s small. It’s important to control your blood pressure with medications during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes occurs when your body cannot process sugars effectively. This leads to higher-than-normal levels of sugar in the bloodstream. Some women will need to modify their meal plans to help control blood sugar levels. Others may need to take insulin to keep their blood sugar levels in control. Gestational diabetes usually resolves after pregnancy. Preeclampsia is also called toxemia. It occurs after the first 20 weeks of a pregnancy and causes high blood pressure and possible problems with your kidneys. The recommended treatment for preeclampsia is delivery of the baby and placenta to prevent the disease from progressing. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits regarding timing of delivery. Your doctor may induce labor if you’re 37 to 40 weeks pregnant. If it’s too early to deliver your baby, your doctor will need to monitor you and your baby closely. They may prescribe medications to help lower your blood pressure and help the baby mature if you are not full term. You may be hospitalized for monitoring and care. Preterm labor occurs when you go into labor before week 37 of your pregnancy. This is before your baby’s organs, such as the lungs and the brain, have finished developing. Certain medications can stop labor. Doctors usually recommend bed rest to keep the baby from being born too early. A miscarriage is the loss of pregnancy during the first 20 weeks. According to the , up to 20 percent of pregnancies among healthy women will end in a miscarriage. Sometimes, this happens before a woman is even aware of the pregnancy. In most cases, miscarriage isn’t preventable. A loss of pregnancy after week 20 of pregnancy is called a stillbirth. Many times the cause for this isn’t known. Issues that have been found to cause stillbirths include: Anemia means that you have a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells in your body. If you have anemia, you may feel more tired and weak than usual, and you may have pale skin. Anemia has many causes and your doctor will need to treat the underlying cause of the anemia. Taking supplements of iron and folic acid during your pregnancy may help since most cases of anemia occur due to a deficiency. A variety of bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections may complicate a pregnancy. Infections can be harmful to both the mother and the baby, so it’s important to seek treatment right away. Some examples include: hepatitis B virus, which can spread to your baby during birth toxoplasmosis, which is an infection caused by a parasite found in cat feces, soil, and raw meat You can prevent some infections by washing your hands often. You can prevent others, such as hepatitis B virus and influenza, by vaccination. Complications can also occur during labor and delivery. If there’s a problem during labor, your doctor may need to change the way they proceed with the delivery. A baby is considered in a breech position when their feet are positioned to be delivered before their head. According to the , this occurs in about 4 percent of full-term births. Most babies born in this position are healthy. You doctor will recommend against a vaginal birth if your baby shows signs of distress or is too big to pass safely through the birth canal. If your doctor finds out that your baby is in the breech position a few weeks before delivery, they might try to change the position of the baby. If the baby is still in the breech position when labor starts, most doctors recommend a cesarean delivery. Placenta previa means that the placenta is covering the cervix. Doctors will usually perform a cesarean delivery if this is the case. Low birth weight usually occurs due to poor nutrition or the use of cigarettes, alcohol, or drugs during pregnancy. Babies who are born at a low birth weight have a higher risk of: The baby may need to stay in the hospital for a few months after birth. If you’re pregnant, don’t hesitate to call your doctor if there are any signs of a problem. Call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following: You should also call your doctor if you think your baby is suddenly moving less often than usual during the third trimester. Not all complications are preventable. The following steps may help promote a healthy pregnancy and prevent you from having a high-risk pregnancy: If you’re thinking of becoming pregnant, consult with a doctor beforehand to help you prepare. For example, if you already have a pre-existing medical condition, your doctor may recommend adjusting your treatment to prepare for your pregnancy. Eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, and fiber. In general, the recommends a total of 25 to 35 pounds of weight gain for women who were at a healthy weight before pregnancy. Attend all routine prenatal visits, including those with a specialist if one is recommended. Ask your doctor if the medications you’re already taking are okay to continue taking or if you should stop taking them. Reduce your stress levels. Listening to music and doing yoga are two ways to reduce your stress levels. — When Conceiving Is Complicated: How Infertility Impacts Intimacy What to Expect When You’re in the Latent (Early) Phase of Labor When Conceiving Is Complicated: How Infertility Impacts Intimacy Medically reviewed by Sometimes the act of getting pregnant ends up having very little to do with sex.

afd6fdb9-145d-4fae-82a6-4b0462f722fc,"What Are the Causes of Shoulder Pain During Pregnancy? — If you’re pregnant you know that all the new, exciting changes in your body come with a few hiccups. Some of these include and feeling aches, butterflies, and tingles in your belly and back. Pregnancy can also cause pain in parts of the body that seem pretty far removed from where all the action is taking place. You might be surprised to learn that your new shoulder pain may be directly linked to your pregnancy. Shoulder pain (like other aches) can be normal in pregnancy. But, in some cases, shoulder pain — along with other symptoms — might be a sign that something’s not quite right. in your pregnancy you have shoulder pain is important. Here’s what to know and what to do if you have shoulder pain during pregnancy. Shoulder pain during pregnancy can happen at any time, and for many reasons. Most of the time, it’s normal. It happens due to changes to your muscles and joints. Causes can include straining your back, sleeping in a funny position, not having good posture, and standing for too long. Typical (and non-worrisome) shoulder pain during pregnancy might feel like stiffness or achiness. It shouldn’t feel like severe or stabbing pain. Your body makes a hormone called relaxin even before you get pregnant. This hormone also has lots of different jobs from the beginning of pregnancy to the birth of your baby. Relaxin helps your body grow and change for your developing little one. Essentially, relaxin does this by loosening your connective tissue, which can cause aches and pains in various places — including your shoulders. As your baby grows, so does your body in order to nourish this new blossoming life. In the , your baby bump begins to show and your body shape and weight changes for a healthy pregnancy. The changes in your body impact how you’re sleeping, sitting, standing and even walking. In fact, one small medical found that those in their second trimester had a slower gait (walking speed) than people who weren’t pregnant. This means that even though you may not very pregnant yet, the changes in your body are affecting your muscles and how you carry yourself. This can lead to muscles aches, including shoulder pain. In the , you obviously have lots of changes in your body as your little one gets ready to make their entrance. Your body adapts to carrying around a baby and a mini portable nursery in many ways — including literally curving your spine! In the same 2015 as above, researchers compared the spines of 19 pregnant women in their third trimester to women who weren’t pregnant. They found that the lumbar (lower end) of the spine in the pregnant women in their third trimester was more curved. This means that your spine looks more like an “S” later in pregnancy to help handle the extra pounds of baby, food, blood, and more. The changes in your spine can lead to changes in your back and shoulder muscles. This may lead to normal shoulder pain and aches during pregnancy. Also in the third trimester, relaxin continues to help relax your ligaments so that your pelvic bone joints can loosen up and open to better deliver your baby. Other joints in your body also loosen up, including your shoulder joints. Relaxing the shoulder joint, along with changes to your posture, , how you walk, and everything else can lead to normal shoulder pain during the third trimester. More serious causes of shoulder pain can happen at any time during your pregnancy, too. That’s why you should let your doctor know if you have shoulder pain or any other unusual symptoms. If you feel pain in your shoulder very early in your first trimester, the cause might be an or tubal pregnancy. This is when the embryo implant outside the uterus — usually in the Fallopian tube. People with an ectopic pregnancy typically have symptoms between weeks 4 and 12 of pregnancy. You might have symptoms before you even know you’re pregnant or before you’ve seen your doctor. An ectopic pregnancy may cause shoulder tip pain. This may feel like a sudden, strange pain just between your shoulder and arm. This serious cause of shoulder pain in pregnancy actually happens because there is bleeding in the abdomen. This bleeding can’t be seen, but it can irritate the nerve responsible for the involuntary muscles that move the diaphragm. In turn, the nerve transmits sensory information from the diaphragm and the shoulder region, creating the perception of pain — referred pain — in the shoulder. You’ll likely have other symptoms along with the shoulder pain, like: An ectopic pregnancy requires immediate medical attention. The hormones that help you get and stay pregnant can also cause side effects — including, in rare instances, . You might not know you have gallstones at all, but if a gallstone gets stuck in a duct or tube, it can cause serious symptoms.

Other include: severe pain in your upper right abdomen that gets worse sudden pain in the middle of your abdomen that gets worse Pain from gallstones can last for minutes or even hours. In serious cases, you may have a high fever and even (yellowing of the skin and eyes). You might need surgery to remove the gallstones if you have a serious blockage or other . But in most cases, gallstones can be treated with lifestyle changes, like: In the second or third trimester, shoulder pain may be one of the symptoms of . This serious condition happens when you have high blood pressure (hypertension) and other complications during pregnancy or after your delivery. Symptoms usually happen after week 20 of pregnancy, but they can happen earlier. Aside from shoulder pain, other signs of preeclampsia include: Treatment for preeclampsia includes checking your blood pressure several times a day and seeing your doctor for regular checkups. You may need medication, a low-sodium , and bed rest to help control your blood pressure. If your preeclampsia symptoms don’t improve, your doctor may recommend delivering your baby early. You’ll typically recover shortly after having your baby.

You should feel better with: massages — just try to see a practitioner who’s knowledgeable about pregnancy sleeping support pillow — Ask your doctor about which is safe during pregnancy and right for you. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is normally OK to take occasionally.

Always reach out to your doctor if you have any unusual, new, or strange symptoms during pregnancy — including severe shoulder pain or pain that doesn’t get better. Call your doctor and get urgent medical care if you think you might have an ectopic pregnancy or if you feel any kind of severe, sharp pain. You may need emergency treatment or even surgery to help prevent harmful complications from an ectopic pregnancy.

f16e5ba9-a28c-49a2-b308-0f9dffc492f8,"— happens after an egg is fertilized and burrows into the womb. Sometimes, though, these delicate beginning stages can get mixed up. When this happens, a pregnancy may not go the way it should — and this can be heartbreaking, even though it’s no one’s fault. A occurs when the doesn’t develop normally. Instead, a tumor forms in the uterus and causes the placenta to become a mass of fluid-filled sacs, also called cysts. About pregnancies (0.1 percent) is a molar pregnancy. This kind of pregnancy doesn’t last because the placenta typically can’t nourish or grow a baby at all. In rare cases, it may also lead to health risks for mom. A molar pregnancy is also called a mole, a hydatidiform mole, or gestational trophoblastic disease. You can have this pregnancy complication even if you have had a typical pregnancy before. And, the good news — you can have a completely normal, successful pregnancy after having a molar pregnancy. There are two kinds of molar pregnancy. Both have the same result, so one isn’t better or worse than the other. Both kinds are usually — they don’t cause cancer. A complete mole happens when there’s only placenta tissue growing in the womb. There’s no sign of a fetus at all. In a partial mole, there is placenta tissue and some fetal tissue. But the fetal tissue is incomplete and could never develop into a baby. You can’t control whether or not you have a molar pregnancy. It’s not caused by anything you did. A molar pregnancy can happen to women of all ethnicities, ages, and backgrounds. It sometimes happens because of a mix-up at the genetic — DNA — level. Most women carry hundreds of thousands of eggs. Some of these might not form correctly. They’re usually absorbed by the body and put out of commission. But once in a while an imperfect (empty) egg happens to get fertilized by a sperm. It ends up with genes from the father, but none from the mother. This can lead to a molar pregnancy. In the same way, an imperfect sperm — or more than one sperm — may fertilize a good egg. This can also cause a mole. There are some risk factors for a molar pregnancy. These include: Although it can happen to anyone, you may be more like to have a molar pregnancy if you’re . If you’ve had a molar pregnancy in the past, you’re more likely to have another one. (But again — you can also go on to have a successful pregnancy.) A molar pregnancy may feel just like a typical pregnancy at first. However, you’ll likely have certain signs and symptoms that something is different. You may have bright red to dark brown bleeding in the first trimester (up to 13 weeks). This is more likely if you have a complete molar pregnancy. The bleeding might have grape-like cysts (tissue clots). The hormone hCG is made by the placenta. It’s responsible for giving many pregnant women a certain amount of nausea and vomiting. In a molar pregnancy, there may be more placenta tissue than normal. The higher levels of hCG might lead to severe nausea and vomiting. Tissues in a molar pregnancy grow faster than they should, especially in the second trimester. Your stomach may look too large for that early stage in pregnancy. The fast growth can also cause pressure and pain. Sometimes a molar pregnancy is diagnosed when you go for your usual pregnancy scan. Other times, your doctor will prescribe blood tests and scans if you have symptoms that might be caused by a molar pregnancy. A pelvis ultrasound of a molar pregnancy will typically show a grape-like cluster of blood vessels and tissue. Your doctor may also recommend other imaging — like MRI and CT scans — to confirm the diagnosis. High levels of hCG in the blood might also be a sign of a molar pregnancy. But some molar pregnancies may not raise hCG levels — and high hCG is also caused by other standard kinds of pregnancies, like carrying twins. In other words, your doctor won’t diagnose a molar pregnancy based on hCG levels alone. What are the treatment options for a molar pregnancy? A molar pregnancy can’t grow into a normal, healthy pregnancy. You must have treatment to prevent complications. This can be really, really hard news to swallow after the initial joys of that positive pregnancy result. With the right treatment, you can go on to have a successful pregnancy and healthy baby. Your treatment may involve one or more of the following: With a , your doctor will remove the molar pregnancy by dilating the opening to your womb (cervix) and using a medical vacuum to remove the harmful tissue. You’ll be asleep or get local numbing before you have this procedure. Although a D&C is sometimes done as an outpatient procedure at a doctor’s office for other conditions, for a molar pregnancy it’s typically done at a hospital as an inpatient surgery. If your molar pregnancy falls into a higher risk category — due to cancer potential or because you have had difficulty getting proper care for whatever reason — you may receive some chemotherapy treatment after your D&C. This is more likely if your hCG levels don’t go down over time. A is surgery that removes the entire womb. If you don’t wish to get pregnant again, you might choose this option. You’ll be fully asleep for this procedure. A hysterectomy is a common treatment for a molar pregnancy. If you have , you’ll receive a drug called RhoGAM as part of your treatment. This prevents some complications related to developing antibodies. Be sure and let your doctor know if you have A-, O-, B-, or AB- blood type. After your molar pregnancy is removed, you’ll need more blood tests and monitoring. It’s very important to make sure that no molar tissue was left behind in your womb. In rare cases, molar tissue can regrow and cause some types of cancers. Your doctor will check your hCG levels and give you scans for up to a year after treatment. Again, cancers from a molar pregnancy are rare. Most are also very treatable and have a survival rate of up to . You may need chemotherapy and radiation treatment for some cancers. If you think you’re pregnant, see your doctor right away. As with many things, the best way to prevent complications from a molar pregnancy is to get diagnosed and treated as early as possible. After treatment, see your doctor for all follow-up appointments. It’s best to wait to get pregnant again for up to a year after treatment. This is because pregnancy can mask any rare, but possible complications after a molar pregnancy. But talk to your doctor — your situation is unique, just like you are. Once you’re completely in the clear, it’ll likely be safe for you to get pregnant again and have a baby. Also know that cancers and complications from molar pregnancies are very rare. In fact, the advises that prior molar pregnancies or other risk factors for developing the related cancerous tumors shouldn’t factor into family planning. Molar pregnancies aren’t common, but they can happen to women of all ages and backgrounds. A molar pregnancy can be a and emotionally draining experience. The treatment and waiting period can also take a toll on your emotional, mental, and physical health. It’s important to take the time to grieve for any kind of pregnancy loss in a healthy way. Ask your doctor about support groups. Reach out to other women who have gone through a molar pregnancy. Therapy and counseling can help you look forward to a healthy pregnancy and baby in the not-so-distant future. — Spotting in pregnancy may not be a sign that anything is wrong, but you should still let your doctor know.

a1643345-c3a5-48ef-80c8-1023bef6697d,"— Overall, a , commonly referred to as a cesarean section or C-section, is an extremely safe operation. Most of the serious complications associated with cesarean deliveries aren’t due to the operation itself. Instead, the complications come from the reason for the cesarean delivery. For example, a woman whose placenta separates too early () may require an emergency cesarean delivery, which can involve significant blood loss. In this case, problems arise primarily from the placental abruption — not the actual surgery. In other situations during labor and delivery, an emergency requiring a cesarean delivery may arise. There may not be time to get an epidural or spinal anesthetic (because these forms of anesthesia are complicated to get), and general anesthesia may be required. In these cases, complications may arise from the general anesthesia. Complications of general anesthesia are considerably greater than those seen with spinal or epidural anesthesia. Many complications of cesarean delivery are unpredictable and very rare, but there are some things that make complications more likely. These risk factors include: emergency complications that necessitate a cesarean delivery Some possible complications of cesarean deliveries are as follows: Fortunately, serious complications from cesarean deliveries are rare. In developed countries, maternal death is very rare. Death of the mother is more likely for women who have a cesarean delivery than for women who have a vaginal birth, but this is probably related to complications with the pregnancy that make a cesarean delivery essential. Each of the main complications of a cesarean delivery is described in more detail below. After the membranes have ruptured, the uterus is especially susceptible to infection — the bacteria that normally inhabit the vagina (which are generally harmless) can easily spread to the uterus. If bacteria are in the uterus, a cesarean delivery incision may result in endometritis (infection of the uterus). Endometritis can be a direct consequence of a cesarean delivery (chances are increased for women who’ve had cesarean deliveries). Fortunately, almost all cases of endometritis can be treated with antibiotics, and this type of infection doesn’t seem to keep women from having safe pregnancies in the future. In very rare cases, the infection may be serious and require a hysterectomy. In extremely rare cases, the infection may result in death. It is important to know that these complications are so rare that during their entire careers, most obstetricians won’t see a single case of hysterectomy or death due to infection. Serious infections are rare in women who have planned cesarean deliveries before labor and before the membranes are ruptured. Problems like this are more common after long labors, when the membranes have been ruptured for a long time before the surgery begins. Some women develop an infection at the site of the incision on the outer skin layers, instead of in the uterus. This is often called post-cesarean wound infection. Infections of the wound are often associated with fever and abdominal pain. Infection of the skin or any layer of tissue that was cut can normally be treated with antibiotics. These infections can also cause abscesses that fill with pus. If an abscess exists, a doctor may have to re-open the wound to drain and clean the infected area. The woman’s recovery can be slow. Sometimes, the infection can spread to other organs or the type of bacteria that infects the wound can be very aggressive. These infections are rare but can be dangerous. With proper treatment, such as antibiotics and hospitalization, even the most serious infections can be cured. Cesarean delivery is the for . This infection often starts in the uterus or vagina. If it spreads throughout the body, it is called sepsis. Most of the time, the infection is caught early. It can usually be cured with antibiotics. If the infection is untreated and sepsis occurs, it is harder to treat. In rare cases, sepsis can be deadly. A fever in the first 10 days after the cesarean delivery is a warning sign for puerperal fever. Infections like urinary tract infections or mastitis (infections in the breasts) can be a sign of this complication. They should be treated quickly to avoid the spread of the infection. While the average blood loss for a vaginal birth is about 500 cc (about two cups), the average blood loss with a cesarean delivery is : about four cups, or one quart. This is because the pregnant uterus has one of the greatest blood supplies of any organ in the body. In every cesarean delivery, large blood vessels are cut as the surgeon opens the wall of the uterus to gain access to the baby. Most healthy pregnant women can tolerate this much blood loss without any difficulty. Occasionally, however, blood loss can be greater than this and cause (or arise from) complications. The following forms of dangerous blood loss can happen during or after a cesarean delivery: postpartum hemorrhaging, atony, lacerations, and placental accreta. It is normal to lose a lot of blood during a cesarean delivery. When you bleed too much, this may be called a postpartum hemorrhage. This can happen when an organ is cut, the blood vessels aren’t stitched up completely, or there is an emergency during labor. They can also be caused by a tear in the vagina or nearby tissue, a large episiotomy, or a ruptured uterus. Some women have problems clotting blood, which makes it hard to stop bleeding after any type of cut, tear, or bruise. About 6 percent of deliveries result in postpartum hemorrhaging. In some cases, blood loss isn’t a problem. Pregnant women have about 50 percent more blood than women who aren’t pregnant. Hemorrhages are emergencies, though, and should be treated immediately by a doctor. If you continue bleeding heavily after you are sent home from the hospital, call a health professional immediately for advice. After receiving treatment, most women make a full recovery in a few weeks. In some cases, women are given a blood transfusion during or after the cesarean delivery to replace lost blood. Medicine, IV fluids, iron supplements, and nutritious foods or vitamins are recommended to help you regain your strength and blood supply after hemorrhaging. After the baby and the placenta are delivered, the uterus must contract to close the blood vessels that supplied the placenta during pregnancy. Uterine atony is when the uterus remains relaxed, without tone or tension. This can happen after a long labor or the birth of a big baby or twins. When the uterus has atony, bleeding may be very fast. Fortunately, a number of very effective medications have been developed to treat uterine atony. Most of these drugs are variations of natural substances in the body called. With the use of prostaglandins, long-term complications from uterine atony are extremely rare. If drugs don’t work and hemorrhage is significant, surgical removal of the uterus may be necessary Sometimes the cesarean delivery incision isn’t wide enough for the baby to pass through, especially when the baby is very large. As the baby is delivered through the incision, the incision may tear into areas not intended by the surgeon. The areas to the right and left of the uterus have big arteries and veins that can be torn accidentally. Often, there is nothing the surgeon can do to avoid such tears; every obstetrician will see this problem many times. If the doctor notices a tear quickly, it can be safely repaired before too much blood loss occurs. Sometimes, these tears affect blood vessels near the uterus. Other times, the surgeon may accidentally cut into arteries or nearby organs during the operation. For instance, the knife sometimes hits the bladder during a cesarean delivery because it is so close to the uterus. These lacerations can cause heavy bleeding. They also might require extra stiches and repairs. In rare cases, damage to other organs requires a second surgery to fix. When the tiny embryo travels into the uterus, the cells that will form the placenta begin to collect on the walls of the uterus. These cells are called. Trophoblasts generally grow through the walls of the uterus and into the blood vessels of the mother. These cells play an important role in moving oxygen and nutrients from mother to fetus. They also move waste products from fetus to mother. As the fetus and placenta grow, the trophoblasts keep seeking blood vessels to support the growing fetus. A fibrous layer (called) limits how deep the villi are able to reach into the wall of the uterus. When the uterus has been damaged (for instance, from a previous cesarean delivery) the fibrous layer may not stop the trophoblasts from growing deep into the mother’s uterus. They may even spread into other organs, such as the bladder. This condition is called. Placenta accreta is especially common in women who have had a cesarean delivery in the past and whose embryo, during a later pregnancy, implants in the area of the cesarean delivery scar. Although this complication is rare, doctors are now seeing it more often because of the large number of cesarean deliveries that have been performed in the last 10 years. The good news is that doctors are now able to recognize when women are at risk for this condition and are usually ready to deal with it. The bad news is that almost all cases require a hysterectomy to save the life of the mother. Since the chances of this happening tend to increase with each cesarean delivery a woman has, some women try vaginal birth after a previous cesarean delivery to reduce their risk of placenta accreta or a hysterectomy. Cesarean hysterectomy is the removal of the uterus right after a cesarean delivery. Certain complications of cesarean delivery (usually connected to severe bleeding) may require the doctor to remove the uterus to save the mother’s life. Even though the risk of a hysterectomy is higher after a cesarean delivery, bleeding requiring a hysterectomy may happen even after a seemingly normal vaginal birth. As with all of the complications listed above, cesarean hysterectomy is very rare. Most obstetricians will probably need to do an emergency hysterectomy only a few times in their careers. Women who have had a hysterectomy cannot have more children, but there are usually no extra side effects from this operation. Obviously, this is a terrible situation, and physicians try their best to avoid it. There is no question that cesarean hysterectomies save lives, though, especially when bleeding cannot be controlled by simpler measures. Planned cesarean hysterectomy | Cesarean hysterectomy Although a hysterectomy immediately following cesarean delivery is probably easier than performing one later, blood loss is greater. For this reason, most surgeons don’t plan cesarean hysterectomies — even when a woman has other conditions that might require a hysterectomy. Under certain circumstances, however, a cesarean hysterectomy may be planned. This is only done when there is a serious need to do the hysterectomy for reasons unrelated to pregnancy. The mother’s health must also be good and her blood count high. Otherwise, cesarean hysterectomies are done only in the case of emergency, as in the cases above. Probably the most feared complication of cesarean delivery deliveries is the formation of blood clots in the mother’s legs or pelvic area. These blood clots can break off and travel to the lungs. If this happens, it is called a pulmonary embolism. This complication is the leading cause of death among pregnant women in most developed countries. Fortunately, the clots usually cause swelling and pain in the legs, and most women bring this to their doctor’s attention before the clots travel to the lung. If a blood clot is found early, it can be treated with use of a blood thinner (such as Coumadin or Warfarin). Occasionally, there are no warning signs until after the clots have broken off and reached the lungs. Most women recover with treatment, but sometimes the clot can be so large that the mother dies. Unfortunately, there doesn’t appear to be a reliable way of avoiding or detecting this condition. Blood clots are more common in the following situations: The mother has had a long period of bed rest after the operation. Blood clots were much more common in the past, when women were commonly told to remain in bed for weeks after giving birth. Fortunately, they are less common today. Blood clots are more common when a woman is pregnant than when she isn’t for two reasons. First, estrogen is produced in large amounts by the placenta. This increases the body’s production of clotting proteins. It is important that blood forms clots quickly after delivery to avoid the bleeding complications above. Second, as the baby grows, the uterus puts pressure on the veins that bring blood back from the mother’s legs. This slows blood flow during pregnancy. The combination of slow blood flow and increased ability to clot leads to a higher risk of clotting complications during pregnancy. Adverse reactions to medication, latex, or anesthesia In addition to problems caused by the actual surgery, some women experience complications related to medication, latex, or anesthesia. Bad reactions to these items can range from very mild (like a headache or dry mouth) to very serious (like death from ). Problems with drugs, latex products, and anesthesia are more common with emergency cesarean deliveries. This is because there is sometimes not enough time to double check for all possible drug interactions or allergies, find latex substitutes, or provide localized (instead of general) anesthesia. Some women have severe allergies to medications or products used in a cesarean delivery operation. If the doctor doesn’t know about these allergies, it may be impossible to avoid a bad reaction. In addition, general anesthesia is risker than localized anesthesia. Sometimes general anesthesia must be used because there isn’t enough time to use local anesthetics before the first cut must be made. General anesthesia can cause problems for the mother and also cause the baby to be drowsy when they are born. When a cesarean delivery is planned ahead of time, the medical workers have the chance to ask about allergies and plan the anesthesia. Although these problems are less likely to arise in planned surgeries, they can still happen. Sometimes, the mother doesn’t know she has an allergy to medications or anesthesia. Severe reactions are very rare. Rare but serious problems from medication, latex, or anesthesia reactions include: Most of these reactions happen soon after the drug or item is used. Serious reactions can be deadly, but most are treatable with other drugs and rest. Women experiencing a bad reaction need immediate medical help. Although they may need a longer hospital stay and may not be able to benefit from certain drugs during their surgery, most women don’t have lasting problems from bad reactions to medication, latex, or anesthesia. Many women experiencing cesarean delivery deliveries struggle with emotional issues after the baby is born. Some women express dissatisfaction with the delivery experience or process and mourn the loss of the opportunity to deliver vaginally. Other women may initially experience difficulty bonding with the baby. Many women overcome these emotional difficulties by spending time in direct skin contact with the baby, joining a postnatal cesarean delivery support group, or discussing their concerns in therapy. In addition to these emotions, women who have experienced other cesarean delivery complications (such as an emergency hysterectomy) may have emotional difficulty adjusting to infertility or inability to deliver vaginally in the future. Women experiencing these losses should discuss their feelings and seek treatment from a mental health professional or specialty support group if necessary. Some cesarean delivery complications — like a hysterectomy — make it impossible for a woman to have another baby. However, even if the surgery goes well and the mother heals, she may have difficulties with pregnancy in the future. This can happen because of scar tissue at the site of the cesarean delivery. In some cases, cesarean delivery scarring can connect the uterus to the bladder. When they are connected, future cesarean deliveries are more likely to damage the bladder. Future pregnancies may also implant in dangerous areas, like the cesarean delivery scar. The surgery may also leave the wall of the uterus weak, making a future vaginal birth difficult or even dangerous. Though many women can have a successful vaginal birth after a prior cesarean delivery, in some cases the uterus will tear open at the site of the old cut. If this happens, another cesarean delivery is needed to protect the mother and the baby. Although very rare, some women die from complications with a cesarean delivery. Death is almost always caused by one or more of the complications listed above, like uncontrolled infection, a blood clot in the lung, or too much blood loss. Although many of the complications above can happen after vaginal births as well, the is three to four times higher. Even though this difference seems very large, maternal death after cesarean deliveries is still extremely rare. Out of pregnancy-related deaths, are caused by the problems described above. The rest are caused by other problems, like heart trouble or high blood pressure. Death from cesarean delivery complications or any pregnancy-related cause is very rare in the U.S. and other developed countries. Women aren’t the only ones who can have complications from a cesarean delivery. Sometimes, the baby may also have problems. The following complications may affect the baby: Just as the mother’s skin, blood vessels, and organs can be injured by the surgery, the baby can also be accidentally cut during a cesarean delivery. This is rare (1 to 2 percent of cesarean deliveries); any cuts are usually very small and heal quickly. More often, babies have some problems breathing when they are born via cesarean delivery. They may need extra care to breathe or thrive right after birth. Babies born via cesarean delivery are also than babies born vaginally to have low Apgar scores. Apgar scores measure how healthy your baby seems shortly after birth. Many babies are born via cesarean delivery because of other problems (like a slow heartbeat, fetal distress, or a long labor). The problems that lead to a cesarean delivery — and the anesthesia from the surgery itself — can cause some temporary problems that show up as a low Apgar score. Finally, some babies born via cesarean delivery have problems because they are preterm. This often happens when a woman goes into labor early because of a problem with the pregnancy. It also happens when the gestational age of the baby is calculated incorrectly. Sometimes, a cesarean delivery is planned for a time when the baby is thought to be near or at term, but after the operation it is clear the age was wrong and the baby was delivered too early. Babies born too early can have problems with growth and development. When the baby is full term and the cesarean delivery is planned, complications for the baby are rare and usually temporary. There is no research that shows a permanent difference between babies born vaginally and babies born in a cesarean delivery. — What Does It Feel Like When You Have a Blood Clot?

12213ae5-919e-4777-9605-3b727030be3b,"Can I Eat Chocolate When Pregnant? Research Says ‘Yes’ — in Moderation — You don’t have to use pregnancy cravings as an excuse to want chocolate — it’s almost universally popular. But your pregnancy may have you questioning what you can and cannot eat. Here’s the good news: Chocolate is safe for you to enjoy in moderation. Here’s why. Chocolate is perfectly safe to consume during pregnancy, as long as we’re talking about a few pieces rather than a six pack of king-sized candy bars. Like most things in life, moderation is a good general rule. Some moms-to-be use their pregnancy as a time to be extra cautious about their diet, and monitor their intake of things like caffeine, sugar, and unnecessary additives. And this is often for good reason: Research has shown that consuming too many calories and high amounts of added sugar during pregnancy can lead to negative health outcomes for both mom and baby. For example, high sugar diets during pregnancy have been with a higher risk of: For this reason, it’s suggested that pregnant women keep their added sugar intake to a minimum to avoid these potential complications. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t enjoy chocolate. It just means that chocolate and other foods and beverages high in added sugar should be enjoyed in moderation. Additionally, you can help cut your added sugar intake by choosing chocolate products that are lower in added sugar than others. Very sweet chocolates include white chocolate and candy bars (think Hershey’s Milk Chocolate bars, for example). In general, the darker the chocolate, the less sugar it contains. (But the higher the caffeine — which brings us to our next common safety concern.) An additional concern is caffeine intake, as too much caffeine has been linked to . Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends 200 milligrams of caffeine or less per day during pregnancy. Rest assured: You can definitely stay under this amount while still enjoying your occasional piece of chocolate. Again, the type of chocolate matters. Dark chocolate has almost triple the caffeine amount as milk chocolate. If you’ve already had two cups of coffee for the day, a large portion of chocolate will set you over the recommended caffeine intake amount. Simply tracking your intake for a few days can give you an idea of how much caffeine you consume on a typical day. You can then make adjustments from there. Benefits of eating chocolate during pregnancy (for you) Ready for the good news? Regular chocolate splurges can actually decrease your risk for and , according to a . Sweeeeet! In the review of more than 2,000 pregnancies, a lowered risk for preeclampsia was associated with chocolate consumption in the first and third trimesters, while the lowered risk for gestational hypertension was associated only with chocolate consumption in the first trimester. (With a caveat that more studies are needed to confirm these findings.) Preeclampsia and gestational hypertension, defined is a condition in which women experience high blood pressure, protein in the urine, and low clotting factors which can be indicative of liver or kidney issues. It can be dangerous for moms and babies, and is the reason your OB will monitor your blood pressure closely throughout your pregnancy. is as systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or more, or diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg or more after 20 weeks of gestation And while you can’t substitute your prenatal vitamin for a chocolate bar, there are other of dark chocolate in particular. For example, dark chocolate contains minerals including magnesium, copper, and iron. Just like that handful of blueberries you suspect you should be eating, dark chocolate also contains antioxidants, which are helpful to anyone’s health, not just pregnant women. One found that 8 days of daily dark chocolate consumption led to improvements in certain markers of brain function compared to a placebo group. Benefits of eating chocolate during pregnancy (for baby) If you want to get the blood pumping to your for optimal growth, chocolate may be the secret. In a of two groups of pregnant women, participants consumed 30 grams of chocolate every day for 12 weeks (tough study to be a part of, right?). Both groups — one consuming low flavonol and one consuming high flavanol chocolate — showed increased blood flow to the fetus at their ultrasounds. In addition, those myths your grandma has been cooing about over your growing belly may just be backed by science: Eating chocolate may cause “sweeter” temperaments in babies, revealed. Around 300 mothers were studied, and the ones who consumed chocolate daily rated their 6-month-olds as having a more positive temperament. Then again, perhaps those mamas saw their babies more positively because chocolate puts us in a better mood. During the third trimester, the same positive correlation between chocolate and blood flow can present more of a concern, though scientists aren’t completely sure of the effects yet. examined eating chocolate in the third trimester and said it’s possible there could be negative effects on the baby’s ductus arteriosus (DA) late in pregnancy. The DA is a fetal blood vessel important for development that disappears shortly after birth. Researchers basically suggested women should be careful when consuming chocolate during this part of the pregnancy: The anti-inflammatory effects of chocolate may backfire during the third trimester. But you’d likely have to eat a of chocolate for it to have a negative impact. Recommendations for eating chocolate during pregnancy You can enjoy chocolate, especially dark chocolate, in moderation throughout your pregnancy. The benefits are largely well proven, including possibly reducing blood pressure and risks of some complications, and also improving blood flow to the baby and to the mother. There is some evidence that in the third trimester chocolate is more of a risk, but it hasn’t been proven to the point that doctors are recommending against it. Finally, throughout pregnancy, you may want to monitor your total caffeine and sugar intake, and make sure that eating chocolate is factored into those totals. Pregnancy has enough anxieties and stressors that you have to worry about. Luckily, that midnight chocolate craving isn’t one of them. — 11 Foods and Beverages to Avoid During Pregnancy - What Not to Eat Can You Eat Sushi While Pregnant?

a0d1e8a4-f358-4655-b9a6-668ada3d4a07,"— Preeclampsia is a condition that commonly presents in pregnancy, but can occur postpartum in some cases. It causes and possible organ failure. It more commonly occurs after week 20 of pregnancy and can happen in women who didn’t have high blood pressure before pregnancy. It can lead to serious complications with you and your baby that can sometimes be fatal. If left untreated in the mother, preeclampsia can lead to or and potential cardiovascular problems in the future. It can also lead to a condition called , which can cause seizures in the mother. The most severe outcome is stroke, which may lead to permanent brain damage or even maternal death. For your baby, it can prevent them from receiving enough blood, giving your baby less oxygen and food, leading to slower development in the womb, a low birth weight, premature birth, and rarely stillbirth. If you had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy, you are at an increased risk of developing it in future pregnancies. Your degree of risk depends on the severity of the previous disorder and the time at which you developed it in your first pregnancy. In general, the earlier you develop it in pregnancy, the more severe it is and the more likely you are to develop it again. Another condition that can be developed in pregnancy is called , which stands for hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count. It affects your red blood cells, how your blood clots, and how your liver functions. HELLP is related to preeclampsia and about 4 to 12 percent of women diagnosed with preeclampsia develop HELLP. HELLP syndrome can also cause complications in pregnancy, and if you had HELLP in a previous pregnancy, regardless of the time of onset, you have a greater risk for developing it in future pregnancies. Causes of preeclampsia are unknown, but several factors in addition to having a history of preeclampsia can put you at a higher risk for it, including: having high blood pressure or kidney disease before pregnancy family history of preeclampsia or high blood pressure being obese or having a body mass index (BMI) over 30 To diagnose preeclampsia, your doctor will most likely check your blood pressure and perform blood and urine tests. Can I still deliver my baby if I have preeclampsia? Although preeclampsia can lead to serious issues during pregnancy, you still can deliver your baby. Because preeclampsia is thought to result from problems developed by the pregnancy itself, delivery of the baby and placenta are the recommended treatment to stop progression of the disease and lead to resolution. Your doctor will discuss the timing of delivery based on the severity of your disease and your baby’s gestational age. Most patients have resolution of the elevated blood pressure within days to weeks. There is another condition called that occurs after childbirth, the symptoms of which are similar to preeclampsia. See your doctor immediately if you experience any preeclampsia symptoms after childbirth, as it can lead to serious issues. If you do develop preeclampsia again, you and your baby will be monitored regularly. Treatment will focus on delaying the progression of disease, and delaying the delivery of your baby until they have matured in your womb long enough to minimize the risks of preterm delivery. Your doctor may monitor you more closely, or you may be hospitalized for monitoring and certain treatments. This will depend on the severity of the disease, the gestational age of your baby, and your doctor’s recommendation. corticosteroids, to help your baby’s lungs develop more fully If preeclampsia is detected early, you and your baby will be treated and managed for the best possible outcome. The following may decrease your chances of developing preeclampsia in a second pregnancy: After your first pregnancy and before a second one, ask your doctor to perform a thorough evaluation of your blood pressure and kidney function. If you or a close relative has had vein or lung blood clots before, ask your doctor about testing you for clotting abnormalities, or thrombophilias. These genetic defects may increase your risk for preeclampsia and placental blood clots. If you are obese, consider weight loss. Weight reduction may decrease your risk of developing preeclampsia again. If you have insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, be sure to stabilize and control your blood sugar level before becoming pregnant and early in pregnancy to reduce your risk of developing preeclampsia again. If you have chronic high blood pressure, talk with your doctor about getting it well controlled prior to pregnancy. To prevent preeclampsia in a second pregnancy, your doctor may recommend you take a low dose of aspirin late in your first trimester, between 60 and 81 milligrams. The best way to improve the outcome of your pregnancy is to see your doctor regularly, to begin prenatal care at the onset of your pregnancy, and keep all your scheduled prenatal visits. Likely, your doctor will obtain baseline blood and urine tests during one of your initial visits. Throughout your pregnancy, these tests may be repeated to aid in early detection of preeclampsia. You will need to see your doctor more frequently to monitor your pregnancy. Preeclampsia is a serious condition that can lead to severe complications in both the mother and baby. It can lead to kidney, liver, heart, and brain problems in the mother and can cause slow development in the womb, a premature birth, and low birth weight in your baby. Having it during your first pregnancy will increase your chances of having it during your second and subsequent pregnancies. The best way to treat preeclampsia is to identify and diagnose it as early as possible and to monitor you and your baby closely throughout your pregnancy. Medications are available to reduce blood pressure and manage the symptoms of the disease, but ultimately, the delivery of your baby is recommended to stop progression of preeclampsia and lead to resolution.

92a61268-11c6-46f9-9b24-139295f4ffb9,"— The second trimester is often when people feel their best during pregnancy. Nausea and vomiting usually resolve, the risk of miscarriage has dropped, and the aches and pains of the ninth month are far away. Even so, there are a few complications that can occur. Read on to learn what to watch for and how to prevent complications from occurring in the first place. Although a miscarriage is much less common in the second trimester, it can still occur. Vaginal bleeding is usually the first warning sign. Miscarriages in the second trimester (before 20 weeks) may be caused by several different factors, which can include: A wall, or septum, inside the uterus divides it into two separate parts. When the cervix opens too soon, causing early birth. Examples include or . These diseases can occur when your immune system attacks healthy cells. This is when something is wrong with the baby’s chromosomes, which are cells that are made up of DNA. Other causes of bleeding in the second trimester include: problems with the placenta, such as (placenta covering the cervix) (placenta separating from the uterus) These problems are more common in the third trimester, but they can also occur late in the second trimester. If you have have , get an injection of immunoglobulin (RhoGAM) if you experience bleeding during pregnancy. Immunoglobulin is an antibody. An antibody is a protein your immune system produces that recognizes and fights harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. Getting a shot of immunoglobulin will help prevent the development of Rh antibodies, which will attack the fetus if it has an Rh-positive blood type. You may feel scared if you experience vaginal bleeding, but it’s important to remember that not all bleeding means pregnancy loss. Seek immediate care if you’re bleeding in pregnancy, but try to stay calm while the doctor understands why you’re bleeding. You may be put on bed rest until the bleeding stops. When labor occurs the 38th week of pregnancy, it’s considered preterm. Various conditions may cause preterm labor, such as: chronic health condition, like or extra amniotic fluid (the fluid surrounding the fetus) infection of the amniotic fluid or amniotic membranes The signs and symptoms of preterm labor may be subtle. They can include: In other cases, the symptoms of preterm labor are more obvious, such as: Call your doctor if you have these symptoms and are worried about being in labor. Depending on your symptoms, your doctor may tell you to go to the hospital right away. Each additional day you don’t go into preterm labor offers a chance for fewer complications when the baby is born. Several medications can be helpful in stopping preterm labor. These include: If preterm labor can’t be stopped, your doctor will give you a steroid medication. Doing so helps develop the baby’s lungs and reduces the severity of lung disease. It’s most effective two days after the first dose, so your doctor will try to prevent delivery for at least two days. It’s for your membranes to rupture (break) during labor. People often refer to it as “your water breaking.” This occurs when the amniotic sac surrounding the baby breaks, allowing the amniotic fluid to flow out. That bag protects the baby from bacteria. Once it’s broken, there’s a concern of the baby getting an infection. While your water is supposed to break when you go into labor, it can cause serious problems for your baby when it happens too early. This is called . The exact cause of PPROM isn’t always clear. In many cases, though, the source of the problem is an infection of the membranes. PPROM in the second trimester is a big concern, as it can lead to a preterm delivery. Infants born between the 24th and 28th weeks of pregnancy are at the greatest risk for developing serious long-term medical problems, particularly lung disease. The good news is that with the appropriate intensive care nursery services, most preterm infants tend to do very well. Treatment for PPROM varies. It can often include: medications that can stop labor, such as If there are signs of an infection, labor may be induced to avoid serious complications. Antibiotics will be started to prevent infection. Many babies are born within two days of rupture, and most will deliver within a week. In rare cases, especially with a slow leak, the amniotic sac can reseal itself. Preterm labor can be avoided, and the baby is born closer to their due date. The cervix is a tissue that connects the vagina and the uterus. Sometimes, the cervix is unable to withstand the pressure of the growing uterus during pregnancy. The increased pressure can weaken the cervix and cause it to open before the ninth month. This condition is known as cervical incompetence, or cervical insufficiency. While it’s an uncommon condition, it can cause serious complications. The opening and thinning of the cervix eventually leads to the rupture of membranes and delivery of a very premature fetus. This usually occurs around the 20th week of pregnancy. Since the fetus is too premature to survive outside the uterus at that point, the pregnancy often can’t be saved. Women are at a higher risk for cervical incompetence if they’ve had: a previous cervical trauma, such as a tear during delivery Unlike preterm labor, cervical incompetence typically doesn’t cause pain or contractions. There may be vaginal bleeding or discharge. Treatment for cervical incompetence is limited. An emergency cerclage (stitch around the cervix) is a possibility if the membranes haven’t ruptured yet. The risk of rupturing the membranes is higher if the cervix is very dilated (wide). Extended bed rest is necessary after the placement of a cerclage. In other cases, when the membranes have already ruptured and the fetus is old enough to survive, your doctor will likely induce labor. You can prevent cervical incompetence. If you have a history of it, you can receive a cerclage with future pregnancies at about 14 weeks. This will lower, but not eliminate, the risk of having a preterm delivery and losing the baby. proteinuria (a large amount of protein in the urine) Preeclampsia affects every system in the body, including the placenta. The placenta is responsible for providing nutrients to the baby. Though preeclampsia typically occurs during the third trimester for first-time pregnancies, some people develop preeclampsia during the second trimester. Before making a diagnosis, your doctor will evaluate you for other conditions that may be confused with preeclampsia, such as (which causes inflammation throughout the body) and (a seizure disorder). Your doctor will also evaluate you for conditions that can increase the likelihood of developing early preeclampsia, such as blood clotting disorders and molar pregnancy. That’s a noncancerous tumor that forms in the uterus. Symptoms of preeclampsia include rapid swelling of your legs, hands, or face. Call your doctor right away if you experience this type of swelling or any of the following symptoms: headache that doesn’t go away after taking acetaminophen (Tylenol) “floaters” in your eye (specks or spots in your vision) severe pain on your right side or in your stomach area You’re more prone to injury during pregnancy. Your center of gravity changes when you’re pregnant, which means it’s easier to lose your balance. In the bathroom, be careful when stepping into the shower or tub. You may want to add nonskid surfaces to your shower so you don’t slip. Consider adding grab bars or rails in your shower, too. Also check your house for other hazards that could cause you to fall.

a10f2ed0-814f-4377-bfa7-3a893aab7afc,"— During pregnancy, your body goes through numerous physical changes to accommodate fetal growth and development. Throughout these nine months, it’s ideal to have a normal blood pressure reading. Your blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Every time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries, which then carry the blood to the rest of your body. The blood typically moves through the arteries at a certain rate. However, various factors can disrupt the normal rate at which blood flows through the vessels, causing an increase or decrease in pressure. Increased pressure in the arteries can result in an elevated blood pressure reading. Decreased pressure in the arteries can result in a low blood pressure reading. is recorded as two types of numbers. The systolic number is the top number, which indicates the amount of pressure in the arteries when your heart beats. The diastolic number is the bottom number, which indicates the amount of pressure in the arteries between heartbeats. Your blood pressure naturally rises with each heartbeat and falls when the heart rests in between beats. However, the rapid changes your body goes through during pregnancy can greatly influence these numbers and cause a drastic change in blood pressure. According to the , a normal blood pressure reading is 120/80 mm Hg and below. Readings below 90/60 mm Hg indicate low blood pressure, or . Readings above 140/90 mm Hg in pregnancy indicate high blood pressure, or . Hypertension is seen far more often in pregnancy than hypotension. About of all pregnancies in the United States are complicated by high blood pressure issues. An abnormal blood pressure during pregnancy is a cause for concern. Both you and your baby may be at an increased risk of health complications. However, you may be able to prevent problems by attending regular prenatal appointments so your doctor can monitor your blood pressure closely. You may also want to consider learning more about related conditions so you can help manage factors affecting your blood pressure. The defines abnormal blood pressure readings in non-pregnant adults as follows: Elevated blood pressure is a systolic number between 120 and 129 and a diastolic number lower than 80. In stage 1 hypertension, the systolic number is between 130 and 139 or the diastolic number is between 80 and 89. In stage 2 hypertension, the systolic number is 140 or higher or the diastolic number is 90 or higher. In a hypertensive crisis, the systolic number is higher than 180 and/or the diastolic number is higher than 120. You may not always be able to tell whether your blood pressure is too high or too low. In fact, hypertension and hypotension may not cause noticeable symptoms. If you do experience symptoms, they may include the following: High blood pressure, or hypertension, in pregnancy is usually defined as 140/90 mm Hg or higher. It may cause: Low blood pressure, or hypotension, is usually defined as 90/60 mm Hg or less. It may cause: If you suspect you have symptoms of hypertension or hypotension, you should see your doctor right away to help prevent possible complications. The symptoms of hypertension and hypotension aren’t always present. The best way to know if you have abnormal blood pressure is to take a blood pressure test. Blood pressure tests are often done at regular checkup appointments, and your doctor should perform them throughout your pregnancy. While these tests are most commonly performed in a medical setting, they can also be done . Many local drug stores carry at-home blood pressure monitors that you can use to check your blood pressure. However, make sure to consult with your doctor before you try monitoring your blood pressure at home. Your doctor may have specific instructions regarding when and how often you should check your blood pressure. Causes of abnormal blood pressure during pregnancy The estimates that 1 out of every 3 American adults has hypertension. In pregnancy, hypertension can be classified into two main categories: chronic hypertension and hypertension related to pregnancy. Chronic hypertension refers to high blood pressure that was present before pregnancy. You may also be diagnosed with this condition if you develop hypertension during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. You may still have the condition after giving birth. High blood pressure disorders related to pregnancy generally develop after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. There are several types of disorders that range in severity. A 2016 review published in suggests that age, obesity, and underlying health problems seem to contribute to these conditions. Though these conditions usually go away after you give birth, your risk of getting hypertension in the future is much higher if you develop any of them. Hypotension, while much less common, can be directly related to pregnancy. Your circulatory system expands during pregnancy to accommodate your fetus. As circulation expands, you might experience a small drop in blood pressure. According to the , this is most common during the first 24 weeks of pregnancy. Still, this amount is usually not significant enough to cause concern. , particularly a lack of folic acid, B vitamins, and vitamin D Treating abnormal blood pressure during pregnancy Hypertension in pregnancy must be monitored closely to prevent potentially life-threatening complications. Your doctor will recommend frequent doctor visits for fetal monitoring, as well as urine and blood tests. Your doctor will likely ask you to keep track of how often your baby kicks each day. A decrease in movement may be problematic and may indicate the need for an early delivery. Your doctor will also perform throughout your pregnancy to help ensure that your baby is growing properly. Medications may also be recommended depending on the type and severity of high blood pressure issues you develop. Mild cases of hypotension usually don’t require treatment. Instead, your doctor may advise you to use caution when standing up so you don’t fall. More serious cases may require you to: Complications of abnormal blood pressure during pregnancy Hypertension puts you and your baby at an increased risk of complications. These include: a preterm delivery, which is a delivery that occurs before 37 weeks Hypotension can pose challenges to pregnancy. A showed that nearly half of all cases of hypotension in pregnancy occur in women who already have this condition. This study also reported that women with ongoing hypotension during pregnancy were more likely to have nausea, vomiting, vaginal bleeding, and anemia. Preventing abnormal blood pressure during pregnancy The best way to lower your risk of complications is to prevent abnormal blood pressure in the first place. It’s helpful to visit your doctor for a physical exam before becoming pregnant so that any blood pressure abnormalities can be detected early. It’s also best to be a healthy weight before pregnancy. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, there are no proven methods to prevent high blood pressure during pregnancy. However, you should strive to be in the best possible health before getting pregnant by: managing any preexisting conditions, such as diabetes Outlook for pregnant women with abnormal blood pressure Hypertension that develops during pregnancy is often resolved after giving birth. Make sure to attend regular prenatal checkups so your doctor can monitor the health of your baby and look for any signs of abnormal blood pressure. If your doctor prescribes medication to control your blood pressure, make sure to take the medication as directed. For preexisting cases of elevated blood pressure, you’ll likely need to continue taking medications after your baby is born. — High blood pressure is common during pregnancy, but can also be a serious concern to monitor.

9691579e-0147-4011-bdc7-996ece539722,"— Complications can arise in pregnancies for many reasons. Sometimes a woman’s existing health conditions contribute to problems. Other times, new conditions arise because of hormonal and body changes that occur during pregnancy. Always talk to your doctor if you have any concerns about your risk of complications during pregnancy. Some of the most common complications include the following. is the loss of a pregnancy in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. The reasons for miscarriage are not always known. Most miscarriages occur in the first trimester, which is the first 13 weeks of pregnancy. Chromosomal abnormalities can prevent proper development of the fertilized egg. Or physical problems with a woman’s reproductive system can make it difficult for a healthy baby to grow. Miscarriage is sometimes called spontaneous abortion, as the body rids itself of the fetus much like a procedural abortion. The most common sign of miscarriage is abnormal vaginal bleeding. Other symptoms can include lower abdominal pain and cramping, and a disappearance of pregnancy symptoms, such as . Most miscarriages don’t require surgical intervention. When a miscarriage occurs under 12 weeks, the tissue will often dissolve or pass spontaneously without the need for further intervention. Some will require medicine or a minor procedure in the office or operating room to help with the passage of . A fertilized egg implanted outside of the is an ectopic pregnancy. The egg generally settles in one of the . Because of the space limitations and the lack of nurturing tissues there, a fetus cannot properly grow. An can cause severe pain and damage to a woman’s reproductive system, and is potentially life-threatening. As the fetus continues to grow, it can cause the fallopian tube to burst, leading to severe internal bleeding (hemorrhage). The fetus will not survive in an ectopic pregnancy. Surgery and/or medication are necessary, as well as careful monitoring of a woman’s reproductive system by a gynecologist. Causes of ectopic pregnancy include a condition in which cell tissue that usually grows in the uterus grows elsewhere in the body (endometriosis), and scarring to the fallopian tubes from a previous sexually transmitted infection. is a form of diabetes that is diagnosed during pregnancy. It means that you are also at higher risk for diabetes after pregnancy. Like type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes is caused by insulin resistance (your body doesn’t respond correctly to the hormone insulin). For most women, gestational diabetes doesn’t cause any noticeable symptoms. While the majority of women with gestational diabetes give birth to healthy babies, the condition can increase the risk that the baby will have a larger-than-normal body. Gestational diabetes is treated through changes in diet and close monitoring of blood sugar levels. Oral medication to lower glucose levels may also be necessary. The goal is to keep the mother’s sugar levels within a normal range for the remainder of the pregnancy. A growing baby puts continual pressure on a pregnant woman’s cervix. In rare cases, the pressure becomes too much for the cervix to handle. This will cause the cervix to open before the baby is ready to be born, which is called cervical insufficiency or an incompetent cervix. Women who have previously had a pregnancy complicated by cervical insufficiency or who have had surgery on their cervix are most susceptible. Symptoms are often and nonspecific. Most women who have cervical insufficiency have no idea that their cervix is thinning or shortening. The hallmark of this condition is that it’s painless. However, some women do report a feeling of pressure or mild cramping. Cervical insufficiency is diagnosed by measuring the length of the cervix with . The treatment may include bed rest, vaginal suppositories of the hormone progesterone, or a procedure called cerclage. A cerclage is a minor surgery in which bands of strong thread are stitched around the cervix to reinforce it and hold it closed. The treatment for cervical insufficiency will depend on many factors, including the length of your cervix, your gestational age, and the outcome in previous pregnancies if you have been pregnant before. Placental abruption occurs when the placenta completely or partially separates from the uterus before a baby is born. This separation means a fetus cannot receive proper nutrients and oxygen. A placental abruption happens most commonly in the third trimester of pregnancy. Common symptoms include vaginal bleeding, contractions, and abdominal pain. There is no definitive answer as to why abruptions occur. It’s thought that physical trauma can disrupt the placenta. High blood pressure can also damage the connection between the placenta and the uterus. A number of factors can increase your risk for abruption. Pregnant women with high blood pressure are much more likely to have an abruption. This is true for blood pressure problems that are unrelated to pregnancy, like chronic , and pregnancy-related problems like toxemia (preeclampsia). The likelihood of abruption is closely related to the number and nature of your previous pregnancies. The more babies you’ve had, the greater your risk of abruption. More importantly, if you’ve had one abruption in the past, you have about a 1 in 10 chance of having an abruption with your next pregnancy. Other factors that may increase the risk for placental abruption include cigarette smoking and drug use. is a rare pregnancy complication that occurs if the placenta attaches to the bottom part of a woman’s uterine wall, partially or completely covering the cervix. When it occurs, it usually happens during the second or third trimester. Some women have a low-lying placenta in early pregnancy, however. A doctor will monitor the condition. But often the placenta moves to the appropriate place without any intervention. Placenta previa becomes a more serious condition in the second or third trimesters. It can result in heavy vaginal bleeding. If left untreated, placenta previa can lead to bleeding heavily enough to cause maternal shock or even death. Luckily, most cases of the condition are recognized early on and treated appropriately. Amniotic fluid cushions the womb to keep a fetus safe from trauma. It also helps maintain the temperature inside the womb. Having too little amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios) or too much amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios) interferes with some of the normal functions of the womb. Low amniotic fluid can prevent a baby from properly developing muscles, limbs, , and affect the . Most cases of excess amniotic fluid are mild and don’t cause problems. In rare cases, too much amniotic fluid can cause: An absence or excess of fluids is usually detected during the second trimester when the fetus begins to practice breathing and sucks in amniotic fluid. For those with too little amniotic fluid, saline solution may be pumped into the amniotic sac to help reduce the risk of compression or injury to the child’s organs during delivery. For those with too much amniotic fluid, medication can be used to reduce fluid production. In some cases, a procedure to drain excess fluids (amnioreduction) may be required. In either case, if these treatments prove ineffective, an induced pregnancy or cesarean delivery may be required. is a condition marked by high blood pressure and high protein levels in a woman’s urine. Through it commonly develops in later pregnancy, after 20 weeks gestation, it can develop earlier in the pregnancy, or even postpartum. Doctors are not sure what causes preeclampsia, and it can range from mild to severe. In serious cases, symptoms may include: You should call your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately if you have severe headaches, blurred vision, or pain in your abdomen. For most women, preeclampsia will not affect the health of the baby. However, some cases of preeclampsia can prevent the placenta from getting enough blood. Preeclampsia can cause serious complications in both mother and baby. Some complications include: The recommended treatment for preeclampsia is delivery of the baby and placenta to prevent the disease from progressing. Your doctor will discuss the risks and benefits regarding timing of delivery. Your doctor may advise waiting to deliver so that the baby can mature further. In this case, close monitoring would take place to ensure safety for you and baby. Medications for high blood pressure (antihypertensives) are sometimes taken, and corticosteroids can be used to help mature a baby’s lungs to prepare for an early delivery. Antiseizure medication is taken in many cases. Seizures can be a common and serious complication for both mother and child. Labor is considered preterm when it occurs after 20 weeks and before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Traditionally, the diagnosis is made when regular uterine contractions are associated with either opening (dilation) or thinning out (effacement) of the cervix. The majority of and birth cases occur spontaneously. However, up to one-fourth are a result of an intentional decision. These cases are generally due to complications in either the mother or the baby. They are best treated by proceeding with delivery, despite the fact that the mother is not yet at her due date. Preterm labor requires prompt medical attention. A woman who experiences symptoms of premature labor may be put on bed rest or be given medication to stop contractions. Many actually go on to deliver at term. There are a host of risk factors associated with premature labor and delivery, including: Venous thrombosis is a blood clot that normally develops in a in a leg. Women are susceptible to clots throughout pregnancy and delivery, and particularly afterward (postpartum). The body increases the blood’s clotting ability during childbirth, and sometimes the enlarged uterus makes it difficult for blood in the lower body to return to the heart. Clots near the surface are more common. Deep vein thrombosis is much more dangerous and far less common. Women have a greater risk of developing clots if they: A molar pregnancy is an abnormality of the placenta. It’s when an abnormal mass, instead of a normal embryo, forms inside the uterus after fertilization. Also called , molar pregnancies are rare. There are two types of molar pregnancies: complete and partial. Complete molar pregnancies occur when the sperm fertilizes an empty egg. The placenta grows and produces the pregnancy hormone hCG, but there is no fetus inside. A partial molar pregnancy occurs when a mass forms that contains both the abnormal cells and an embryo that has severe defects. In this case, the fetus will quickly be overcome by the growing abnormal mass. A molar pregnancy requires immediate dilation and curettage (D&C), and careful follow-up, as the tissue can start growing again and even develop into cancer. occurs when there are mental and physical defects that develop in a fetus when a mother drinks alcohol during pregnancy. Alcohol crosses the placenta, and this has been linked to stunted growth and brain development. HELLP syndrome (, elevated liver enzymes, and ) is a condition characterized by liver and blood abnormalities. HELLP syndrome can occur on its own or in association with preeclampsia. Symptoms often include: Treatment of HELLP usually requires immediate delivery, as there is increased risk of serious health complications for the mother. Complications include permanent damage to her , lungs, and . Eclampsia occurs when preeclampsia progresses and attacks the central nervous system, causing seizures. It’s a very serious condition. If left untreated, it can be fatal for both mother and baby. However, with proper prenatal care, it’s very rare for the more manageable preeclampsia to progress into eclampsia. — When Conceiving Is Complicated: How Infertility Impacts Intimacy What to Expect When You’re in the Latent (Early) Phase of Labor When Conceiving Is Complicated: How Infertility Impacts Intimacy Medically reviewed by Sometimes the act of getting pregnant ends up having very little to do with sex.

The illustrations found throughout this booklet were created by . The information provided in this booklet is designed to provide you with basic, medically accurate information on the fetal development of your unborn child in two-week intervals from conception to birth. It will include such details as average weight and length, organ development and movement for that age. This booklet also includes information on the methods of abortion, as well as the medical risks associated with abortion. In addition, the possible emotional side effects of abortion, the possibility of fetal pain, and some common medical risks associated with carrying a fetus to term are discussed. If You Are Pregnant: Information on Fetal Development, Abortion and Alternatives presents current, medically reliable information. However, each woman and unborn fetus are unique. When considering an abortion, a woman should talk to her doctor about the procedures and alternatives before committing to or paying for an abortion. It is a woman's right to be fully informed about the procedures, complications and risks involved in an abortion. It is a doctor's legal responsibility to provide that information. Additionally, the law requires that your doctor must tell you how old your unborn child is and must give you an opportunity to ask questions. A directory of services is also available. By calling or visiting the agencies and offices in the directory you can find out about alternatives to abortion, obtain assistance in making an adoption plan for your baby; and locate public and private agencies that offer medical and financial help during pregnancy, childbirth and while a child is dependent. The directory is available online: If You Are Pregnant: A Directory of Services Available in Minnesota. (PDF) This document was developed by the Minnesota Department of Health in response to the 2003 legislative passage of the Woman's Right to Know Act. Minnesota laws related to abortion include: [Woman's Right to Know Act] [Abortion; Live Births] [Criminal Acts] [Pregnancy, Venereal Disease, Alcohol or Drug Abuse, Abortion] [Disposition of Aborted or Miscarried Fetuses] You have a right to voluntary and informed consent before agreeing to an abortion. ""Voluntary and informed consent"" means the following information must be provided to you in person or over the phone by the abortion physician at least 24 hours prior to the abortion: Potential medical risks associated with the abortion procedure that will be used in your abortion, including risks of infection, hemorrhage, and danger to subsequent pregnancies and infertility Probable gestational age of the fetus at time of abortion You must be informed by the physician or his/her agent at least 24 hours prior to the abortion: That medical benefits may be available for prenatal care, childbirth and neonatal care That the father is liable to assist in the support of the child That you have the right to review the printed materials that describe the unborn fetus, the list of agencies that offer alternatives to abortion and information on fetal pain The doctor must give you an opportunity to ask questions. You must certify in writing prior to the abortion that the above information has been furnished to you and that you have had an opportunity to review the printed materials. If any of these provisions were not observed, you have the right to take legal action against the abortion provider for actual and punitive damages. When a medical emergency compels the performance of an abortion, the doctor is required to inform you, prior to the abortion if possible, of the medical indications supporting the doctor's judgment that an abortion is necessary. An abortion may be necessary in a medical emergency to avert the death of the woman or because to delay 24 hours will create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function of the woman. Conception (also called fertilization) occurs when a woman's egg is fertilized by a sperm penetrating it. At this moment an individual's unique set of DNA is created, captured in a single cell. Rapid development and growth begin. Within three to four days, the egg begins to develop rapidly. Within a few days the cluster of what is now 32 to 64 cells leaves the fallopian tube and moves into the uterus. This group of cells is now a hollow sphere called a blastocyst. By the eighth day after conception the blastocyst has begun to attach to (implant itself into) the wall of the uterus where it will grow at a rapid rate. The term embryo refers to a developing human from implantation until the eighth week of pregnancy. After the eighth week, the unborn child is referred to as a fetus. Ages in this handbook are listed from both the estimated day of conception and from the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Lengths are measured from the top of the head to the rump. A pregnant woman may notice her first missed menstrual period at the end of the second week after conception, or about four weeks after the first day of her last normal period. There are different kinds of tests for pregnancy. Some may not be accurate for up to three weeks after conception, or five weeks after the first day of the last normal period. The most accurate way to determine if you have a viable pregnancy and its length is by ultrasound. Approximately 2 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Conception, also known as fertilization, occurs when the egg from the woman unites with the sperm from the male, forming a single cell. At this moment, an individual's unique genetic material is created. 4 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. (No illustration of 2 weeks is available.) The cells rapidly divide as they travel down the Fallopian tube. By day 7, the ball of cells, called a blastocyst, begins implanting into the woman's uterus. In the third week, a groove forms along most of the length of the embryo's back. The upper edges of the groove will fold over onto themselves, and begin to create a hollow tube. The embryo is about 1/10 of an inch long at this time. 6 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. Structures that will become arms and legs, called limb buds, begin to appear. On day 22 or 23, the heart begins to beat. By the end of week 4, the heart is circulating primitive blood cells throughout the embryo. By the end of week 4, the edges of the groove have zipped together, forming a hollow tube. This is the neural tube, the beginnings of the brain and spinal cord. 8 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. All vital organs are mapped out and have begun to form. The heart has begun to develop valves and compartments. Tissue that develops into vertebrae forms, the brain develops into five areas and nerve cells are forming in the brain and spinal cord. Facial features - eyes, nose and mouth - continue to develop. 10 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus, until now called an embryo, is about 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 inches long from head to rump (with the head making up about half this size) and weighs less than 1/2 ounce. All major organs and bodily systems are present, although few of them are functional. Muscles and skeleton are developing and movements are becoming purposeful. Structures that form eyes, ears, arms and legs are identifiable. 12 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 2-1/2 inches from head to rump, weighing about 1-1/2 ounces. Fingernails and hair begin to develop and blood is formed in the liver. 14 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 3-1/2 inches from head to rump and weighs about 2 ounces. The fetus begins to swallow and the kidneys produce urine. External genitals have been developing so that the sex can be identified. The nervous system is developing and the fetus may respond to skin stimulation. 16 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 4-3/4 to 5 inches from head to rump and weighs 4 ounces. The head is erect and the arms and legs are developed. If an ultrasound is performed at this time, the parents The fetus has begun to kick, although the woman may not be able to feel the movement. 18 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 5 to 5-1/2 inches from head to rump and weighs 7 to 8 ounces. The skin is pink and transparent and the ears are clearly visible. The fetus can now suck, open the mouth and cover the face with the hands. The fetus can bend and flex the extremities, fingers, wrists, legs and toes and make breathing movements. The brain has been rapidly growing and the central nervous system extends its connections from the brain to most parts of the body. 20 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 6-1/4 inches from head to rump, weighing about 10 to 12 ounces. All organs and structures have been formed, and a period of simple growth begins. The skin is covered with vernix - a greasy material that protects the skin. By this time, the woman may feel the fetus moving. 22 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 7-1/2 inches from head to rump, weighing about one pound (16 ounces). Eyes are fully formed and eyebrows and eyelids are present. Myelin insulation of the spinal cord, which increases the speed that nerves transmit impulses to the brain, is progressing. Pain receptors are present throughout the body and all physical structures necessary to feel pain are present. There is almost no chance that a fetus could survive outside the woman's body. 24 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 8 inches from head to rump and weighs about 1-1/4 pounds. The fetus hears sounds such as the woman's breathing, heartbeat and voice. Rapid eye movement begins, an activity associated with dreaming. Pain receptors are present throughout the body and all physical structures necessary to feel pain are present. Scientific studies have found that a human fetus does not have the capacity to experience pain until at least 24 weeks gestation. In rare cases, infants born as young as 22 weeks survive, but a high percentage have significant complications that affect their long-term survival. 26 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 9 inches from head to rump and weighs about 2 pounds. Substantial weight gain occurs in this period and the fetus is better proportioned. Lungs produce a substance necessary for breathing after birth. Pain receptors are present throughout the body and all physical structures necessary to feel pain are present. Researchers disagree as to whether or not pain is perceived by the fetus. Infants born between 24 weeks and term have a good chance of survival with intensive medical care. 28 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 10 inches from head to rump and weighs about 2-1/2 pounds. Pain receptors are present throughout the body and all physical structures necessary to feel pain are present. Researchers disagree as to whether or not pain is perceived by the fetus. Most of the infants born now will survive (with intensive care services). 30 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 10-1/2 inches from head to rump and weighs almost 3 pounds. The fetus has lungs that are capable of breathing air, although intensive care may be needed. Rhythmic breathing and body temperature are now controlled by the brain (or Central Nervous System). Pain receptors are present throughout the body and all physical structures necessary to feel pain are present. Researchers disagree as to whether or not pain is perceived by the fetus. Nearly all infants born now will survive (with intensive care services). 32 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 11 inches from head to rump and weighs more than 3 pounds. From this stage on, fetal development centers mostly around growth. It is generally agreed that the fetus perceives pain from 29 or 30 weeks, if not before. Almost all infants born now will survive (with intensive care services). 34 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 11-3/4 to 12 inches from head to rump and weighs about 4-1/2 pounds. It is generally agreed that the fetus perceives pain from 29 or 30 weeks, if not before. Almost all infants born now will survive (some will need intensive care services). 36 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 12-1/2 inches from head to rump and weighs about 5-1/2 pounds. It is generally agreed that the fetus perceives pain from 29 or 30 weeks, if not before. Infants born at 33 weeks or more survive outside the womb, usually without medical help. 38 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 13-1/2 inches from head to rump and weighs about 6-1/2 pounds. It is generally agreed that the fetus perceives pain from 29 to 30 weeks, if not before. Infants born at 33 weeks or more survive outside the womb, usually without medical help. 40 weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The fetus is about 14 inches from head to rump, may be more than 20 inches overall and may weigh from 6-1/2 to 10 pounds. Abortion Methods and Their Associated Medical Risks If a woman has made an informed decision and chosen to have an abortion, she and her doctor must first determine how far her pregnancy has progressed. The gestational age of the embryo or fetus will directly affect the appropriateness or method of abortion. Different methods of abortion are used at different gestational ages. Because the date of the beginning of the last normal period may be uncertain, women are advised to have an ultrasound exam to determine the gestational age of the embryo or fetus. At or prior to eight weeks after the first day of the last normal menstrual period is considered the safest time to have an abortion. The risk of complications for the woman in- creases with advancing gestational age. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) states: ""Although cramping and bleeding are an expected part of ending a pregnancy, rarely, serious and potentially life-threatening bleeding, infections, or other problems can occur following a miscarriage, surgical abortion, medical abortion, or childbirth."" Risks associated with early abortion, including death, are relatively low. Serious and minor complications following medical, aspiration or D & E abortions are also infrequent. Possible complications include infection, missed or incomplete abortion, cervical tear, uterine perforation and hemorrhage require transfusion. Minor complications are estimated to occur in fewer than 2.5% of abortions and serious complications (those requiring hospitalization) in fewer than .5%. Recently, increased risk of premature birth has been shown to be associated with abortion. Premature births are associated with infant mortality and childhood complications such as chronic lung disease, cerebral palsy, sensory deficits, cognitive impairments and behavior problems. The risks or possible complications associated with an abortion are listed under each abortion procedure and are further described under the and sections. Non-surgical (medical) abortion is an abortion method approved by the FDA for pregnancies up to 70 days after the last menstrual period. This method is also referred to as RU-486. A drug is given that stops the hormones needed for the fetus to grow. The drug also causes the placenta to separate from the uterus, ending the pregnancy. A second drug is given by mouth or placed in the vagina causing the uterus to contract and push out the fetus and placenta, ending the pregnancy. An appropriate location should be selected for taking these drugs, because they may cause bleeding, cramps, nausea, diarrhea and other symptoms that usually begin within 2 to 24 hours. 7 to 14 days after taking the drugs, a woman must return to the doctor to make sure that the drugs succeeded in ending the pregnancy and that the fetus and placenta are completely gone from the uterus. If the pregnancy is not ended by the drug combination, a surgical abortion may be required. According to the FDA, women should not use the drugs in a medical (non-surgical) abortion who: Are using an IUD (intrauterine device or system); it must be taken out before a medical abortion Have a pregnancy outside the uterus (ectopic pregnancy) Have problems with their adrenal glands (chronic adrenal failure) Have allergies to either of the drugs used in the abortion method Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure about all your medical conditions before taking these drugs. Cramping and vaginal bleeding are expected with this abortion. The complication rate for first trimester non-surgical abortion is 5% (four times the complication rate of aspiration abortion). Rarely, serious and potentially life-threatening complications occur: Vacuum aspiration is the most common used method of induced abortion in the United States. A local anesthetic is applied or injected into or near the cervix to reduce discomfort or pain. The opening of the cervix is gradually stretched with a series of dilators. The thickest dilator used is about ½ inch wide. A cannula (a thin, hollow tube with a sharp pointed end) is inserted into the uterus. The cannula is attached to a suction system that removes the fetus, placenta and membranes from the woman's uterus. A follow-up appointment should be made with the doctor. Cramping and vaginal bleeding are an expected part of this abortion. The overall complication rate for vacuum aspiration abortion is approximately 1.25%. Premature birth associated with subsequent pregnancies Rarely, serious and life-threatening complications occur The cervix is dilated using one of the following methods. One method uses sponge- like tapered pieces of absorbent material laced into the cervix to dilate the cervix over a period of several hours or overnight. Another method is to insert dilating rods of increasing sizes in the cervix until the cervix has been dilated to an opening wide enough to accept the medical instruments. Following dilation of the cervix, intravenous medications may be given to ease discomfort or pain and prevent infection. After a local or general anesthesia has been administered, the fetus and placenta are removed from the uterus with medical instruments such as forceps and suction. Occasionally for removal, it may be necessary to dismember the fetus. Cramping and vaginal bleeding are an expected part of this abortion. Labor Induction (Including Intra-Uterine Instillation) Medicine is placed in the cervix to soften and dilate it. Medication is given directly into the bloodstream (vein) of the pregnant woman to start uterine contractions. Medication inserted into the vagina to start uterine contractions. Medication is injected directly into the amniotic sac by inserting a needle through the woman's abdomen and into the amniotic sac (bag of waters). This medication kills the fetus and starts uterine contractions. Labor and delivery of the fetus during this period are similar to the experiences of childbirth. The duration of labor depends on the size of the fetus and the contractility of the uterus. There is a small chance that a fetus could live for a short period of time depending on the fetus's gestational age and health at the time of delivery. This method is more physically and emotionally stressful to the woman than the D&E method. If the placenta is not completely removed during labor induction, the doctor must open the cervix and use suction aspiration to remove remaining placenta and tissue. Labor induction abortion carries the highest risk for problems, such as infection and heavy bleeding. When medicines are used to start labor, there is a risk of rupture of the uterus. As with childbirth, possible complications of labor induction include infection, heavy bleeding, stroke and high blood pressure. Other medical risks may include blood clots in the uterus, heavy bleeding, cut or torn cervix, perforation of the wall of the uterus, pelvic infection, incomplete abortion, and anesthesia related complications. The risk of complications for the woman increases with advancing gestational age (see above for a description of the abortion procedure that your doctor will be using and the specific risks). Medical abortions have four times as many complications as surgical abortions. Bacteria (germs) from the vagina may enter the cervix and uterus and cause an infection, blood can become infected (septicemia), surgical incisions can become infected and infections from unknown sources can develop. Infections can be mild or severe. Antibiotics are used to treat an infection. In rare cases, a repeat suction, hospitalization or surgery may be needed. Infection rates are about .2% for first trimester medical and surgical abortions and under 1% for dilation and evacuation (D & E), and 5% for labor induction. Fetal parts or other products of pregnancy may not be completely emptied from the uterus, requiring further medical procedures. Incomplete abortion may result in infection and bleeding. In the first trimester, the reported rate of such complications is between 5% and 10% for medical abortions and less than 1% after a dilation and curettage (D & C). In later abortions, the rate is less than 1% in dilation and evacuation (D & E) following a labor induction procedure, the rate may be as high as 36%. Blood clots that cause severe cramping occur in about 1% of all abortions. The clots usually are removed by a repeat dilation and suction curettage. Some amount of bleeding is common following an abortion. Heavy bleeding (hemorrhaging) is not common and may be treated by repeat suction, medication or, rarely, surgery. Ask the doctor to explain heavy bleeding and what to do if it occurs. The opening of the uterus (cervix) may be torn while it is being stretched open to allow medical instruments to pass through and into the uterus. This happens in less than 1% of first trimester abortions. A medical instrument may go through the wall of the uterus. The reported rate is 1 out of every 1,000 with early abortions and 3 out of every 1,000 with dilation and evacuation (D & E). Depending on the severity, perforation can lead to infection, heavy bleeding or both. Surgery may be required to repair the uterine tissue, and in the most severe cases hysterectomy may be required. As with other surgical procedures, anesthesia increases the risk of complications associated with abortion. The reported risks of anesthesia- related complications is around 1 per 5,000 abortions. Most are allergic reactions producing fever, rash and discomfort. Early abortions that are not complicated by infection do not cause infertility. Complications associated with an abortion may make it difficult to become pregnant in the future or carry a pregnancy to term. Increased risk of premature birth has been shown to be associated with abortion. Premature babies (""preemies"") have higher risk of death in their first year of life and raised risk of autism, cerebral palsy, deafness, blindness, and cognitive impairments (developmental disability). The National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the American Cancer Society (ACS) report that scientific research studies have shown no increased risk of developing breast cancer if a woman has had an abortion. When a medical emergency requires the performance of an abortion, the physician shall tell the woman, before the abortion if possible, of the medical indications supporting the physician's judgment that an abortion is necessary to avert her death or that a 24-hour delay will create serious risk of substantial and permanent impairment of a major bodily function. There is no evidence to suggest that a fetus experiences pain. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, scientific studies have found that a human fetus does not have the capacity to experience pain until at least 24 weeks gestation. Stress and anxiety is expected when making a decision about a pregnancy---whether deciding to continue the pregnancy, have an abortion, or place the child for adoption. These feelings are normal. Some women may experience loss of appetite, difficulty sleeping and loss of interest in enjoyable activities. Reaching out to family and friends can provide essential support during this time. If these feelings continue or get worse, you should contact your health care provider. Talking with a counselor or physician not associated with an abortion provider may help a woman to consider her decision fully before taking any action. Many organizations listed in the Minnesota Department of Health Resource Guide offer counseling services at no cost. The directory is online: If You Are Pregnant: A Directory of Services Available in Minnesota. Labor is the process in which a woman's uterus contracts and pushes, or delivers, the fetus from her body. The fetus may be delivered through the woman's vagina, or by caesarean section. A caesarean section is a surgical procedure that delivers the fetus after making a cut (incision) through the woman's belly and uterus. A woman who carries the pregnancy to full term (40 menstrual weeks, 38 weeks after fertilization) can usually expect to experience a safe and healthy process. For a woman's best health, she should visit her physician before becoming pregnant, early in her pregnancy, and at regular intervals throughout her pregnancy. Uterine infection – 10% may develop during or after delivery, and on rare occasions cause death Blood pressure problems – 1 in 20 pregnant women have during or after pregnancy, especially first pregnancies Blood loss – 1 in 20 women experience during delivery Rare events such as blood clot, stroke or anesthesia – related death Women with severe chronic diseases are at greater risk of developing complications during pregnancy, labor and delivery Risk of dying as the result of a pregnancy complication is 12 per 100,000 women Resources for Women with Adverse Pregnancy Diagnoses Sometimes prenatal testing or screening reveals an unexpected diagnosis of a serious disease, deformity or chromosomal disorder. Initial fear or medical care providers may lead a woman toward abortion. In these circumstances, a woman may want to get a second opinion due to the possibility of false positive test results. Perhaps she may simply want to get additional information before making a decision. Connecting with other parents who have children with the same or a similar condition has the ability to bring comfort and a new perspective. This connection with those who have knowledge of the benefits of medical care and useful therapies, support groups, and the everyday realities of caring for their children, allows a woman to see beyond the diagnosis and consider parenting her child or placing her child for adoption in a family she may feel is better able to provide for his or her needs. - This Minnesota organization provides support, information and encouragement for women and families with an adverse prenatal diagnosis, as well as support for raising children with special needs after birth. - SOFT is a valuable resource for patients and families seeking information about support and medical subjects. Resources include a free e-booklet ""Care of the Infant and Child with Trisomy 18 or Trisomy 13"". - ITA offers trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 support groups, physicians and other professionals' accurate information and resources. Resources include booklet ""Preparing for your Baby's Arrival"". - This organization provides information and support to people with Down syndrome, their families and communities. Their website includes an Expectant Parent page and a New Parent page. - The mission of this organization is to ensure that every child born with Down syndrome has the opportunity to grow up in a loving family. There are no fees for any of the services of the NDSAN. - Provides resources, education and support to women and families who receive a diagnosis of Down syndrome; makes connections to other parents with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) children. Financial Assistance for Pregnancy, Childbirth, and Newborn Care You may qualify for financial help for prenatal (pregnancy), childbirth and neonatal (newborn) care, depending on your income. For people who qualify, programs such as Medical Assistance (MA) or MinnesotaCare may pay or help pay the cost of doctor, clinic, hospital and other related medical expenses to help with prenatal care, childbirth delivery services and care for newborns. You can apply for health coverage by going to . Click on 'Medical Assistance or MinnesotaCare' or 'special enrollment period'. Being pregnant qualifies you for special enrollment as a life event. You can also call MNSure at 855-366-7873. Women or couples facing an untimely pregnancy may choose to make an adoption plan. Counseling and support services are key parts of the adoption decision process. These resources are available from a number of public and private adoption agencies without obligation or commitment. All adoption services are available to birthparents without cost. Further information and a list of adoption agencies can be found in the Minnesota Department of Health resource guide, If You Are Pregnant: A Directory of Services Available in Minnesota. There are several ways to consent to the adoption of a child. Talking with a Minnesota Licensed Adoption Agency or an attorney familiar with adoption will help identify the method that will best serve you and your baby. Birth parents decide whether they want to remain anonymous or participate in a more open adoption that includes selecting adoptive parents and establishing a plan for communication over time. After your baby is born, if you are unable or unwilling to care for him or her, you can take your baby to any licensed hospital in Minnesota and give him or her to a hospital employee. You can do this until the baby is three days old, no questions asked. You are not required to give your name or any other information. It's safe and anonymous. You do not need to tell anyone. If you would rather not go yourself, you can give a family member, friend or any responsible adult permission to bring your baby to a hospital. The father of a child has a legal responsibility to provide for the financial support, medical care and other needs of his child. In Minnesota, that responsibility includes child support payments to the child's mother or legal guardian. Children have rights of inheritance from their father and may be eligible through him for benefits such as life insurance, Social Security, pension, veteran's or disability benefits. Additionally, children benefit from knowing their father's medical history and any potential health problems that can be passed genetically. The biological parents state under oath that they are the parents of the child. This statement will assure benefits to the child. It also will establish the father's parental rights. A legal action can be brought in court to determine the biological and legal father of a minor child. This process, in addition to obtaining all of the benefits of a Recognition of Parentage, establishes child support orders, custody and visitation rights. An adjudication also establishes paternity when paternity is contested. It provides legal safeguards to all parties involved. Issues of paternity affect the legal rights of both parents and of the child.

b7e5a970-78a4-4255-994b-f7a513514f60,"﻿ Treating Vaginitis Naturally During Pregnancy :: American Pregnancy Association Treating vaginitis naturally during pregnancy is a frequent concern for expecting mothers. Vaginitis is a general term for the inflammation of the vagina. Vaginitis is common but can be very annoying as it tends to be reoccurring and may interfere with sexual intercourse. Four types of vaginitis include , , , and atrophic vaginitis. This article will focus on the two types most pertinent to pregnant women: and . are caused by a fungus (not by a bacterium, virus, or parasite). It is estimated that will experience a yeast infection during their lifetime. Those who are most susceptible to these infections are pregnant women, , women taking antibiotics, corticosteroid medications, or oral contraceptives (), and/or women with . While some may not experience any symptoms, the most common symptoms of yeast infections include: Burning sensations in the vaginal area during urination and/or sex The most natural way to treat yeast infections is by prevention. Medical studies suggest that wearing tight-fitting undergarments may increase humidity and moisture in vaginal areas, creating an environment more susceptible to yeast infections. Studies would suggest that taking steps to eradicate excess moisture in vaginal areas (such as loose-fitting clothing) may aid in prevention. So, try . Other studies suggest that frequent intercourse (seven or more times a week) is linked to increased risk of yeast infections in women. This may have to do with the alkaline nature of semen which can disrupt the pH balance of the vagina. So, make sure you either and/or ensure you (clean around the vaginal opening with gentle soap, do not douche). Regular consumption of yogurt containing live cultures of bacteria (available in brands such as Dannon and Yoplait) have also been associated with decreased risk of yeast infections in women. This is similar to taking a probiotic supplement. Check labels for the statement “contains live [& active] cultures.” While there is evidence to suggest that these natural treatments may aid in the prevention of yeast infections, there is no foolproof way to entirely safeguard yourself against infection. Self-diagnosis of yeast infections is typically not recommended, as potential misdiagnosis can lead to overuse or misuse of topical creams and other over-the-counter treatment options. If you suspect that you may have a yeast infection, it is best to contact your doctor to discuss your treatment options. If the diagnosis of a yeast infection is confirmed by a medical professional, it is likely they will either suggest an over the counter treatment, or they may prescribe oral medication, antifungal creams, or suppositories. Read more about dealing with yeast infections during pregnancy. Treating Bacterial Vaginosis Naturally During Pregnancy (also known as nonspecific vaginitis) is caused by several different types of bacteria. Many women don’t experience any symptoms, but some may develop a white or grayish, fishy-smelling discharge. In some cases, the discharge may also appear frothy. Unfortunately, bacterial vaginosis cannot be treated naturally. It is important to take action and contact your healthcare provider because bacterial vaginosis has been associated with preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, preterm/pre-labor membrane rupture, and late-term miscarriages. Treating Bacterial Vaginosis when naturally doesn’t work There are various treatment options available for BV including, but not limited to, oral medications, suppositories, and sulfa creams. Current 7-day oral treatments are clindamycin and metronidazole. Vaginal treatment with suppositories and sulfa creams may provide relief of symptoms but are deemed insufficient to prevent complications during pregnancy. If you are experiencing symptoms that lead you to believe you may have bacterial vaginosis, it is imperative to contact your healthcare provider to receive proper treatment.

a17674f8-10fc-448e-be81-c8c7f52922cc,"﻿ Rh Factor Blood Type and Pregnancy :: American Pregnancy Association How Your Rh Factor Blood Type Affects Your Pregnancy Usually your Rh factor blood type isn’t an issue. But during , being  can be a problem if your  is . If your blood and your baby’s blood mix, your body will start to make antibodies that can damage your baby’s . This could cause your  to develop anemia and other problems. Each person’s blood is one of four major types: A, B, AB, or O. Blood types are determined by the types of antigens on the blood cells. Antigens are proteins on the surface of blood cells that can cause a response from the immune system. The is a type of protein on the surface of red blood cells. Most people who have the Rh factor are Rh-positive and those who do not are Rh-negative. As part of your prenatal care, you will have to find out your blood type. If your blood lacks the Rh antigen, it is called Rh-negative. If it has the antigen, it is called Rh-positive. When the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, the fetus can inherit the Rh factor from the father. This makes the fetus Rh-positive too. Problems can arise when the fetus’s blood has the Rh factor and the mother’s blood does not. You may develop antibodies to an Rh-positive baby. If a small amount of the baby’s blood mixes with your blood, which often happens, your body may respond as if it were allergic to the baby. Your body may make antibodies to the Rh antigens in the baby’s blood. This means you have become sensitized and your antibodies can cross the placenta and attack your baby’s blood. They break down the fetus’s red blood cells and produce (a condition that happens when the blood has a low number of red blood cells). This condition is called hemolytic disease or hemolytic anemia. It can become severe enough to cause serious illness, brain damage, or even death in the fetus or newborn. Sensitization can occur any time the fetus’s blood mixes with the mother’s blood. A blood test can provide you with your blood type and Rh factor. Antibody screen is another blood test that can show if an Rh-negative woman has developed antibodies to Rh-positive blood. An injection of Rh immunoglobulin (RhIg), a blood product that can prevent sensitization of an Rh-negative mother. If a woman with Rh-negative blood has not been sensitized, her doctor may suggest she receive RhIg around the to prevent sensitization for the rest of pregnancy. If the baby is born with Rh-positive blood, the mother should be given another dose of RhIg to prevent her from making antibodies to the Rh-positive cells she may have received from their baby before and during delivery. The treatment of RhIg is only good for the pregnancy in which it is given. Each pregnancy and delivery of an Rh-positive child requires repeat doses of RhIg. Rh-negative women should also receive treatment after any , , or induced abortion to prevent any chance of the woman developing antibodies that would attack a future Rh-positive baby. If and when is conducted, fetal Rh-positive red blood cells can mix with a mother’s Rh-negative blood. This would cause her to produce antibodies, therefore making it necessary for RhIg to be given. A Rh-negative mother may receive RhIg after birth, even if she decides to have her fallopian tubes tied and cut to prevent future pregnancies for the following reasons: The woman may decide later to try to have the sterilization reversed. There is a slight chance the sterilization may fail to prevent pregnancy. In case there is a need for a blood transfusion in the future, the treatment will prevent her from developing antibodies. Once a woman develops antibodies, RhIg treatment does not help. A mother who is Rh sensitized will be checked during her pregnancy to see if the fetus is developing the condition. The baby may be delivered on time, followed by a blood transfusion for the baby that will replace the diseased blood cells with healthy blood. For more severe cases, the baby may be delivered early or given transfusions while in the mother’s uterus. The Rh factor does not affect a person’s general health. Problems can occur during pregnancy when the baby’s blood has the Rh factor and the mother’s blood does not, however it can be prevented in most cases with the called immunoglobulin (RhIg).

While there are many harmless causes of this abdominal pain, some may be more serious. As an expectant mother, it is important to educate yourself on all potential causes so you are able to recognize symptoms that may cause concern. Some abdominal aches and pains during pregnancy are quite common and generally pose no threat to you and your baby.  This can be characterized by a sharp stabbing pain when you change positions, or it can also be an achy, dull, lingering pain. Round ligament pain is caused by the two large ligaments that run from your uterus to your groin. As the uterus grows, these ligaments are stretched and create discomfort. This pain is generally reported in the second trimester, and considered to be harmless. Read the full Round Ligament Pain article.

Sometimes labeled “practice contractions,” Braxton Hicks is more of a mild annoyance than a risk to you or your baby. Many women report that Braxton Hicks feel like a tightening of the stomach muscles so your stomach feels firm or hard. It is important to differentiate Braxton Hicks from true contractions.

On average most single pregnancies last 39 weeks, twin pregnancies 36 weeks, triplets 32 weeks, quadruplets 30 weeks, and quintuplets 29 weeks. Almost 60% of twins are delivered preterm, while 90% of triplets are preterm. Higher order pregnancies are almost always preterm. Many times is a result of preterm premature rupture of the membranes (PPROM). PPROM is a rupture of the membranes prior to the onset of labor in a patient who is less than 37 weeks of gestation. Low birth weight is almost always related to preterm delivery. Low birth weight is less than 5.5 pounds (2,500 grams). Babies born before 32 weeks and weighing less than 3.3 pounds (1,500 grams) have an increased risk of developing complications as newborns. They are at increased risk of having long-term problems such as mental retardation, , vision loss, and hearing loss. Multiple pregnancies grow at approximately the same rate as single pregnancies up to a certain point. The growth rate of twin pregnancies begins to slow at 30 to 32 weeks.

If the pregnancy is dichorionic (two chorions present), then intervention may not be necessary. (The chorion is a membrane that forms the fetal portion of the placenta. Fraternal twins always have two chorions while identical twins can have one or two chorions.) If the pregnancy has a single chorion, fetal maturity will be assessed to see if immediate delivery is recommended.

But during , being  can be a problem if your  is . If your blood and your baby’s blood mix, your body will start to make antibodies that can damage your baby’s . This could cause your  to develop anemia and other problems. Each person’s blood is one of four major types: A, B, AB, or O. Blood types are determined by the types of antigens on the blood cells. Antigens are proteins on the surface of blood cells that can cause a response from the immune system. The is a type of protein on the surface of red blood cells. Most people who have the Rh factor are Rh-positive and those who do not are Rh-negative. As part of your prenatal care, you will have to find out your blood type. If your blood lacks the Rh antigen, it is called Rh-negative. If it has the antigen, it is called Rh-positive. When the mother is Rh-negative and the father is Rh-positive, the fetus can inherit the Rh factor from the father. This makes the fetus Rh-positive too. Problems can arise when the fetus’s blood has the Rh factor and the mother’s blood does not. You may develop antibodies to an Rh-positive baby. If a small amount of the baby’s blood mixes with your blood, which often happens, your body may respond as if it were allergic to the baby. Your body may make antibodies to the Rh antigens in the baby’s blood. This means you have become sensitized and your antibodies can cross the placenta and attack your baby’s blood. They break down the fetus’s red blood cells and produce (a condition that happens when the blood has a low number of red blood cells). This condition is called hemolytic disease or hemolytic anemia. It can become severe enough to cause serious illness, brain damage, or even death in the fetus or newborn. Sensitization can occur any time the fetus’s blood mixes with the mother’s blood. A blood test can provide you with your blood type and Rh factor. Antibody screen is another blood test that can show if an Rh-negative woman has developed antibodies to Rh-positive blood. An injection of Rh immunoglobulin (RhIg), a blood product that can prevent sensitization of an Rh-negative mother. If a woman with Rh-negative blood has not been sensitized, her doctor may suggest she receive RhIg around the to prevent sensitization for the rest of pregnancy. If the baby is born with Rh-positive blood, the mother should be given another dose of RhIg to prevent her from making antibodies to the Rh-positive cells she may have received from their baby before and during delivery. The treatment of RhIg is only good for the pregnancy in which it is given. Each pregnancy and delivery of an Rh-positive child requires repeat doses of RhIg. Rh-negative women should also receive treatment after any , , or induced abortion to prevent any chance of the woman developing antibodies that would attack a future Rh-positive baby. If and when is conducted, fetal Rh-positive red blood cells can mix with a mother’s Rh-negative blood. This would cause her to produce antibodies, therefore making it necessary for RhIg to be given. A Rh-negative mother may receive RhIg after birth, even if she decides to have her fallopian tubes tied and cut to prevent future pregnancies for the following reasons: The woman may decide later to try to have the sterilization reversed. There is a slight chance the sterilization may fail to prevent pregnancy. In case there is a need for a blood transfusion in the future, the treatment will prevent her from developing antibodies. Once a woman develops antibodies, RhIg treatment does not help. A mother who is Rh sensitized will be checked during her pregnancy to see if the fetus is developing the condition. The baby may be delivered on time, followed by a blood transfusion for the baby that will replace the diseased blood cells with healthy blood. For more severe cases, the baby may be delivered early or given transfusions while in the mother’s uterus. The Rh factor does not affect a person’s general health. Problems can occur during pregnancy when the baby’s blood has the Rh factor and the mother’s blood does not, however it can be prevented in most cases with the called immunoglobulin (RhIg).

The risk of complications increases the earlier the baby is born. Any complication that premature newborn experiences will be treated in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Below is a list of the most common premature birth complications that a newborn may experience: – Most babies have mature lungs by 36 weeks of gestation. However, since babies develop at different rates, there are exceptions to this. If a mother and her health care provider know that the baby might be coming early, an may be performed to check the maturity level of the lungs. In some cases, an injection of steroids will be given to the baby before the delivery in order to speed the development of the lungs. The major concern in cases of premature labor is the development of the newborn’s lungs. Immature lungs are associated with the following complications: causes harsh, irregular breathing and difficulties due to the lack of a specific agent (surfactant) in the lungs that helps prevent the lungs from collapsing. Treatment involves one or more of the following: supplemental oxygen (through an oxygen hood), use of a respirator (ventilator), continuous positive airway pressure, endotracheal intubation and in severe cases, doses of surfactant. is rapid shallow breathing.

Unfortunately, when preemies are put on a ventilator (also known as respirators) their lungs are still immature and sometimes cannot withstand the constant pressure from the respirator. Preemies that have been on a respirator for more than twenty-eight days are at risk of developing BPD. Preemies can recover from this condition but some take longer to recover than others. – Complications with premature-related respiratory problems can lead to pneumonia. Pneumonia is an infection in the area of the lung involved in the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen. It causes inflammation, which reduces the amount of space available for the exchange of air. This can result in inadequate amounts of oxygen for the baby.  Treatment can include antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, and intubation.  If left untreated, it can develop into a deadly infection or lead to sepsis or . – Apnea is the absence of breathing. In the NICU an alarm will sound if a newborn develops an irregular breathing pattern of pauses longer than 10-15 seconds. Bradycardia is the reduction of heart rate. An alarm will also sound if the newborn’s heart rate falls below 100 beats per minute. Usually, a little tap or simple rub on the back helps remind the preemie to breathe and also increases the heart rate. – A premature baby might not be able to resist certain infections. For its own protection, the baby is placed in an incubator to provide protection against these infections. – A yellowish skin color caused by the buildup of substances in the blood called bilirubin. Treatment involves being placed under a bilirubin light. Treatment is called phototherapy. The procedure can take from one week to 10 days. ) – Babies born sooner than 34 weeks have an increased risk of bleeding in the brain because immature blood vessels might not tolerate the changes in circulation that took place during labor. This can lead to future complications such as mental retardation, and learning difficulties. Intracranial hemorrhage occurs in about 1/3 of babies born at 24-26 weeks gestation. If preterm labor is identified and is inevitable, there are that can be given to the mother to help reduce the risk of severe intracranial hemorrhage in the newborn. – A premature baby is born with little body fat and immature skin, which makes it harder to maintain body heat. Treatment involves incubators to provide warmth. – Premature newborns are born with gastrointestinal systems that are too immature to absorb nutrients effectively. In such cases, they receive their initial nutrients through intravenous (IV) feeding. This is referred to as total parenteral nutrition (TPN). After a few days, newborns may be fed through a tube with or formula because they might not yet have the ability to swallow or suck on their own. – This is a medical condition caused by abnormally low concentrations of red blood cells. Red blood cells are important because they carry a substance called hemoglobin, which carries oxygen. Most premature newborns should have red blood cell levels higher than 15 grams. However, preemies are at a high risk of having lower levels. If the anemia is severe, treatment can involve a transfusion of red blood cells to the newborn. – This is a cardiac disorder that results in breathing difficulties after delivery because of an open blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus. During fetal development, the ductus arteriosus is open to allow blood to be diverted from the lungs into the aorta. A fetus makes a chemical compound called prostaglandin E, which circulates his or her blood thus keeping the ductus arteriosus open. At full term, levels of prostaglandin E fall causing the ductus arteriosus to close, which allows a baby’s lungs to receive the blood needed to function properly after it is born. In the case of preterm labor, the prostaglandin E may stay at the same level causing an open ductus arteriosus. Treatment involves a medication that stops or slows the production of prostaglandin E. – This is a potentially blinding eye disorder. It affects most premature newborns between 24-26 weeks gestation but rarely affects them beyond 33-34 weeks gestation. There are many different stages of this condition, and the prescribed treatment will depend on its severity. Treatments can include laser surgery or cryosurgery. – This condition occurs when a portion of the newborn’s intestine develops poor blood flow, which can lead to infection in the bowel wall. Treatment includes intravenous feeding and antibiotics. Only in severe cases is an operation considered necessary. – This is a medical condition where bacteria enter the bloodstream. Sepsis often brings infection to the lungs and can result in pneumonia. Treatment involves antibiotics.

The placenta may separate from the uterine wall as the cervix begins to dilate (open) during labor. Placenta previa affects about in the of pregnancy. It is more common in women who have had one or more of the following: the cervical opening is completely covered a portion of the cervix is covered by the placenta extends just to the edge of the cervix Signs and symptoms may vary, but the most common symptom is painless bleeding during the third trimester. Uterus measures larger than it should according to gestational age Once diagnosed, treatment will usually include bed rest for the mother and frequent hospital visits. Depending on the gestational age, steroid shots may be given to help mature the baby’s lungs. If the mother experiences bleeding that cannot be controlled, immediate cesarean delivery is usually done regardless of the length of the pregnancy. Some can be delivered vaginally, although or would require a cesarean delivery. Most physicians will also recommend limiting the following activities: The exact cause is unknown. However, the following can increase your risk: Have a history of uterine surgery (regardless of incision type) With all the excitement and anticipation of a healthy delivery, receiving the diagnosis of placenta previa can be a very shocking and frustrating experience. There are support groups for mothers and even some for mothers with placenta previa. They are available to help you through this difficult time.

8097c8f8-8300-4af8-b849-a08c30cb185e,"﻿ is a series of symptoms that make up a syndrome that can affect pregnant women. HELLP syndrome is thought to be a variant of , but it may be an entity all on its own. There are still many questions about the serious condition of HELLP syndrome. The cause is still unclear to many doctors and often HELLP syndrome is misdiagnosed. It is believed that HELLP syndrome affects about . low platelets counts (platelets help the ) It is often assumed that HELLP Syndrome will always occur in connection with preeclampsia, but there are times when the symptoms of HELLP will occur without a diagnosis of preeclampsia being made. About 4-12% of women with diagnosed preeclampsia will develop HELLP syndrome. Unfortunately, since the symptoms of HELLP syndrome may be the first sign of preeclampsia, this is what can often lead to a misdiagnosis. The symptoms of HELLP may cause misdiagnoses of other conditions such as hepatitis, gallbladder disease, or idiopathic/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which is a bleeding disorder. The most common symptoms of HELLP syndrome include: and that continues to get worse–(This may also feel like a serious case of the flu). A woman with HELLP may experience other symptoms that often can be attributed to other things such as normal pregnancy concerns or other pregnancy conditions. Because the symptoms of HELP can mimic many other conditions or complications, it is encouraged that physicians run a series of , including liver function, on any woman experiencing symptoms during the of pregnancy. HELLP syndrome may occur before the third trimester but it is rare. It also may occur within 48 hours of delivery, although symptoms may take up to 7 days to be evident. Blood pressure measurements and urine tests to check for protein are often monitored when diagnosing HELLP syndrome. But the following tests and results are what help a physician to make an accurate diagnosis: The treatment of HELLP Syndrome is primarily based on the gestation of the pregnancy, but the delivery of the baby is the best way to stop this condition from causing any serious complications for mom and baby. Most symptoms and side effects will subside within 2-3 days of delivery. If the pregnancy is less than 34 weeks gestation, doctors usually try to evaluate the lung function of the baby to see how well delivery would be handled. Treatment’s that may be used to manage HELLP until the baby is delivered include: Bed rest and admission into a medical facility to be monitored closely Corticosteroid (to help babies lungs develop more rapidly) Fetal monitoring and tests including biophysical tests, , nonstress tests, and fetal movement evaluation If the pregnancy is more than 34 weeks gestation or the symptoms of HELLP begin to worsen, delivery is the recommended course of treatment. In the past, delivery was the most common way for delivery of babies whose moms were dealing with HELLP syndrome. But it is now recommended that women who are at least 34 weeks gestation and have a favorable cervix should be given a “trial of labor” (TOL). HELLP syndrome does not cause reason for an automatic and in some situations, operative surgery may cause more complications due to the possibility of blood clotting problems related to low platelet counts. Doctors are still unclear on what exactly causes HELLP syndrome. Although it is more common in women who have preeclampsia or , there are still a number of women who get it without previously showing signs of preeclampsia. The following is a list of factors that are believed to increase the risk of a woman developing HELLP syndrome: Previous pregnancy with HELLP Syndrome (19-27% chance of recurrence in each pregnancy) If HELLP syndrome is undiagnosed or untreated, it can result in life-threatening complications for both mother and baby. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC—blood clotting problems that result in hemorrhage) Adult Respiratory distress syndrome (lung failure) Infant respiratory distress syndrome (lung failure) The maternal mortality rate is about 1.1% with HELLP syndrome. The infant morbidity and mortality rate is anywhere from 10-60% depending on many factors such as gestation of pregnancy, the severity of symptoms, and the promptness of treatment. Because there is not a known cause for HELLP syndrome, there is also no identified way to prevent it. Early identification and treatment is the best way to keep HELLP syndrome from getting serious. Since it is believed to be related to preeclampsia, staying vigilant about diet, exercise and healthy blood pressure can only help.

However, bleeding that occurs in the and of pregnancy can often be a sign of a possible complication. Bleeding can be caused by a number of potential reasons. If you are bleeding, you should always wear a pad or panty liner, so that you can monitor how much you are bleeding and what type of bleeding you are experiencing. You should never wear a tampon or introduce anything else into the vaginal area, such as douche or sexual intercourse if you are currently experiencing bleeding. If you are also experiencing any of the other symptoms mentioned below in connection with a possible complication, you should contact your health care provider immediately. Bleeding can be a sign of miscarriage, but does not mean that miscarriage is imminent. Studies show that anywhere from 20-30% of women experience some degree of bleeding in . Approximately half of the pregnant women who bleed do not have miscarriages. Approximately 15-20% of all pregnancies result in a miscarriage, and the majority occur during the first 12 weeks. pain felt low in the stomach (stronger than menstrual cramps) Most miscarriages cannot be prevented. They are often the body’s way of dealing with an unhealthy pregnancy that was not developing. A miscarriage does not mean that you cannot have a future healthy pregnancy or that you yourself are not healthy. Ectopic pregnancies are pregnancies that implant somewhere outside the uterus. The fallopian tube accounts for the majority of ectopic pregnancies. Ectopic pregnancies are less common than miscarriages, occurring in . Cramping pain felt low in the stomach (usually stronger than menstrual cramps) Molar pregnancies are a rare cause of early bleeding. Often referred to as a “mole”, a molar pregnancy involves the growth of abnormal tissue instead of an embryo. It is also referred to as gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD). Grape-like clusters are seen in the uterus by an ultrasound What are the common reasons for bleeding in the first half of pregnancy? Since bleeding that occurs in the first half of pregnancy is so common, many wonder what the causes are besides some of the complications already mentioned. Implantation bleeding can occur anywhere from 6-12 days after possible conception. Every woman will experience implantation bleeding differently—some will lightly spot for a few hours, while others may have some light for a couple of days. Some type of infection in the pelvic cavity or urinary tract may cause bleeding. After intercourse, some women may bleed, because the cervix is very tender and sensitive. You should discontinue intercourse until you have been seen by your doctor. This is to prevent any further irritation—having normal sexual intercourse does not cause a miscarriage. Common conditions of minor bleeding include an inflamed cervix or growths on the cervix. Late bleeding may pose a threat to the health of the woman or the fetus. Contact your health care provider if you experience any type of bleeding in the second or third trimester of your pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding may be caused by the placenta detaching from the uterine wall before or during labor. Only 1% of pregnant women have this problem, and it usually occurs during the last 12 weeks of pregnancy. Women who are at higher risks for this condition include: Placenta previa occurs when the placenta lies low in the uterus partly or completely covering the cervix. It is serious and requires immediate care. It occurs in 1 in 200 pregnancies. Bleeding usually occurs without pain. Women who are at higher risks for this condition include: Vaginal bleeding may be a . Up to a few weeks, before labor begins, the may pass. This is normally made up of a small amount of mucus and blood. If it occurs earlier, you could be entering preterm labor and should see your physician immediately.

During the first two trimesters—or six months—of pregnancy, you typically visit your doctor once a month. After 24 weeks of pregnancy, you visit more frequently—every two weeks until 36 weeks, and then weekly—to ensure your health and that of your baby. At each visit, your weight is checked to determine if you are gaining weight properly, and your blood pressure is measured. Your urine is tested to determine if you have high protein levels, which can indicate if you have an infection or preeclampsia, a pregnancy-related condition that is characterized by high blood pressure. Urine testing is also used to determine your blood sugar, or glucose, levels. If these are high, you may have gestational diabetes, which is a form of the condition that only occurs during pregnancy. During routine visits, your doctor can answer any questions you may have about pregnancy and delivery. If complications develop—such as , which is when a woman’s body prepares for birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy; placenta previa, in which the placenta blocks the birth canal; premature preterm rupture of membranes, which is when the amniotic sac, which surrounds your baby as he or she develops, breaks before 37 weeks; or preeclampsia—your doctor manages your health and your baby’s health more closely. Specialists at NYU Langone are experts in managing conditions that can affect a pregnancy. These include diabetes, , and , such as . Our specialists also manage conditions that can affect delivery. These include a genetic irregularity in the baby, which can result in conditions such as , in which the baby’s spine doesn’t form normally; a baby that is too small or too big; or a baby that is in the breech position, so that the baby’s head is not facing the birth canal prior to birth. In these situations, the doctor may perform additional ultrasound tests or other testing throughout the pregnancy. Between 8 and 10 weeks of pregnancy, your doctor performs an to check the baby’s health and development. Ultrasound helps your doctor to determine how far along the pregnancy is. During an ultrasound, warm gel is rubbed onto your abdomen. A scanning device is then placed on your abdomen, and sound waves transmit images of the baby and the amniotic sac to a high-definition monitor. Sometimes, the due date is adjusted based on the results of this test. The baby’s skull, arms, and legs are evaluated. A nuchal translucency screening is done at this time to measure the thickness of the baby’s neck, which can be a sign of conditions such as Down syndrome. Further testing, such as chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, is then performed to confirm or rule out this diagnosis. Ultrasound tests can also detect the baby’s heartbeat, typically at six weeks. At 16 to 22 weeks of pregnancy, ultrasound testing provides detailed views of the baby’s internal organs, including the brain and the heart. In the third trimester, ultrasound may be used to help your doctor assess the baby’s size prior to delivery. Your doctor tests you for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, or sooner if you are at risk. Gestational diabetes, which can cause high blood pressure, can be a cause of excessive birth weight, which is when a baby is nine pounds or heavier at birth, increasing the need for a cesarean delivery. It can also increase the baby’s risk for metabolic problems—resulting in a rapid heart rate and breathing—and jaundice, which is when there is a yellow discoloration of the baby’s skin, after birth. In this test, you drink a liquid form of glucose that causes your blood sugar levels to rise within 60 minutes. If your blood sugar level is higher than 130 milligrams per deciliter, you then take another test. For 8 hours prior to the second test, you must fast, meaning you do not eat or drink anything. During this test, you drink glucose. Then, your blood is tested immediately and every hour for three hours. If two of the four blood glucose levels are found to be elevated, you have gestational diabetes. Your blood sugar levels must be tested upon wakening and after each meal during your pregnancy. You can do so by using a home monitoring device that measures a drop of blood taken from your finger. You may require insulin to control blood sugar levels and to avoid the complications of gestational diabetes, such as excessive birth weight in the baby. Group B Streptococcus is a bacterium that can be found in the vagina, urinary tract, or rectum. It can be passed to the baby during delivery and cause serious illness. Your doctor tests you for group B strep between 35 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, or sooner if you’re at high risk of preterm labor. If you test positive for group B strep, your doctor gives you intravenous (IV) antibiotics during to prevent infection of the baby. If you are at high risk for pregnancy complications, including preeclampsia, or if you are carrying more than one baby, you may have fetal monitoring tests to evaluate the wellbeing of your baby or babies. These tests are conducted during the third trimester. A biophysical profile test is used by your doctor to evaluate your baby’s breathing rate and muscle tone, as well as the amount of fluid in the amniotic sac. This is done using ultrasound. If this profile determines there are problems with the baby’s wellbeing, a nonstress test may be performed. During this test, a monitor attached to a band is strapped around your abdomen to measure the baby’s heart rate and movements. Every time you feel the baby move, you press a button attached to a monitor. If the results show little movement, you may take the test again to help assess whether the baby is in distress. Your doctor may perform to assess the baby’s risk of certain conditions if you are age 35 or older, or if you had another baby who was born with genetic irregularities. These tests also may be performed if an ultrasound scan indicates a birth defect such as a congenital heart defect. If tests indicate that the mother is a carrier for a genetic condition, the father’s blood may also be tested. In a cell-free fetal DNA test, your blood is tested for chromosomal abnormalities in the baby. This is possible because cells from the placenta, an organ that provides nutrients to the baby in the womb, circulate in the mother’s blood. A positive test result can indicate genetic conditions such as Down syndrome. Between 10 and 14 weeks of pregnancy, your doctor may perform chorionic villus sampling, or CVS, which is a test for genetic abnormalities, such as Tay-Sachs disease, or chromosomal problems that can cause conditions such as Down syndrome. In this test, the doctor inserts a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the vagina into the cervix and placenta. Sometimes, a long, thin needle is inserted through the abdomen instead. Ultrasound helps guide the doctor to the placenta, where he or she collects a sample of chorionic villi, tiny growths that carry genetic material. This sample is tested in a laboratory. Rarely, a CVS test can increase the risk of miscarriage. Often, this test can be performed instead of amniocentesis, which is not performed until the second trimester. Between 11 and 14 weeks, a series of blood screening tests are performed to determine the baby’s risk for certain chromosomal abnormalities. One test determines levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A, the results of which can help your doctor assess the risk of miscarriage or low birth weight in your baby. Your doctor may also perform tests that determine the level of a pregnancy hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin. Low levels can indicate miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, and high levels can indicate pregnancy with multiple babies. The results of these tests, in combination with nuchal translucency screening performed with ultrasound, help identify the baby’s risk for Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities. An amniocentesis can test for genetic abnormalities, such as Down syndrome and cystic fibrosis. It can also determine if a baby has certain birth defects, including neural tube defects, which affect the baby’s brain and spinal cord. In this test, a sample of amniotic fluid, which surrounds and protects the baby in the womb, is taken for analysis. A thin needle is inserted through the abdomen and into the uterus to the fluid-filled amniotic sac. A small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains cells, is extracted and analyzed in a laboratory for irregularities. This procedure is performed after 16 weeks of pregnancy. Rare complications include amniotic fluid leakage, which can cause an infection in the mother’s uterus, and miscarriage. Also known as the quad screen or modified sequential screen, this blood screening procedure identifies four substances: alpha-fetoprotein, a protein produced by the fetus; human chorionic gonadotropin; the hormone inhibin A; and estriol, an estrogen produced by the baby. The results of this test can help determine if the baby has certain genetic conditions. It is performed between 15 and 22 weeks of pregnancy.

d680dfd3-1334-4446-9d5d-43767bb3c20a,"Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can be a sign of a problem with the placenta. Find out what to do about placenta previa and placental abruption. Publications International, Ltd. From the time of the last normal menstrual period to the time of labor, a pregnant woman should not experience any bleeding from the vagina. During the first half of pregnancy, the most serious causes of bleeding are miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy; during the last half of pregnancy, the most serious causes are placenta previa and placental abruption. In placenta previa, the placenta is located low in the uterine cavity, partially or completely covering the opening of the cervix. As the lower portion of the uterus stretches and dilates during the latter weeks of pregnancy, portions of the placenta may be torn from their attachment to the wall of the uterus. This leads to variable amounts of bleeding, ranging from light to profuse. The exact cause of placenta previa is unknown. It is the leading cause of vaginal bleeding during the second and third trimesters. The major symptom of placenta previa is painless vaginal bleeding. This bleeding may begin as early as the 24th to 26th week of pregnancy, though it is more common during the last 4 or 5 weeks. The blood is usually bright red, indicating the bleeding is fresh. This bleeding occurs without any previous injury (for example, from a fall). In some cases, the blood flow is light (referred to as spotting). Abdominal pain or cramping generally does not accompany the bleeding unless the woman is in labor. Any vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is abnormal and should be reported to the doctor immediately. The doctor orders an ultrasound image of the mother's abdomen to locate the placenta. In most cases of placenta previa, the ultrasound shows the placenta covering part or all of the opening of the cervix. Bleeding from a placenta previa may be extremely heavy, leading to severe blood loss from the mother. This bleeding stops only after the baby has been delivered and the placenta has been removed. Unless treatment is rapid in the case of heavy bleeding, death of both the mother and the baby may result. Since the placenta covers part or all of the opening of the cervix, a normal vaginal delivery cannot be attempted since extreme hemorrhage will occur. For this reason, babies of most mothers with placenta previa are delivered by means of cesarean section. Once placenta previa has been diagnosed, the doctor recommends the best treatment -- either delayed or active. Delayed treatment involves admitting the woman to the hospital, keeping her on bed rest, and closely monitoring her for any recurrence of bleeding. The purpose of delayed treatment is to give the fetus time to mature so that it can survive outside the mother's body. Once the maturity of the fetus has been established, delivery is by means of cesarean section. In the case of active treatment, the baby is delivered by means of cesarean section as soon as possible. The degree of vaginal bleeding usually dictates the type of treatment. If vaginal bleeding is slight and the fetus is not yet mature, the doctor generally recommends delayed treatment. If vaginal bleeding is heavy, a cesarean section is performed immediately to save the life of the mother and the baby, even if the baby is premature. After delivery of a baby, the uterus begins to contract, separating the placenta from its wall and pushing it into the vagina. In the case of placental abruption, the placenta begins to separate from the uterine wall before the delivery of the baby. This occurs to some degree in about 1 of every 150 pregnancies. The exact cause of placental abruption is unknown. However, a number of conditions are commonly associated with placental abruption, including high blood pressure in the mother, severe trauma to the mother's abdomen, cigarette smoking or drug use, and advanced age of the mother. The major symptoms of placental abruption are vaginal bleeding and strong, continuous pain over the uterus and sometimes across the back. Bleeding may be as slight as a tablespoon or extremely heavy. In some cases, no bleeding is visible, and the only symptom is pain. If blood loss is great, the woman experiences rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, fainting, and even shock. The diagnosis of placental abruption is made on the basis of the woman's history and the doctor's findings of blood in the vagina and a tender, painful uterus. No specific tests can diagnose placental abruption. In most cases, even the findings on ultrasound are normal. Bleeding associated with a placental abruption may be extremely heavy and, without rapid treatment, may lead to death of both the mother and the fetus. Even if the mother does not bleed heavily, the placenta may separate from the wall of the uterus to an extent that the fetus does not receive a sufficient oxygen supply to survive. In some cases, the mother's blood may fail to clot normally, leading to even more profuse vaginal bleeding. The treatment of placental abruption may be either delayed or active. If vaginal bleeding is slight or has stopped and the fetus remains unharmed, the mother is admitted to the hospital for observation until all signs of placental abruption have stopped. If, on the other hand, vaginal bleeding is heavy or the fetus shows signs of lack of oxygen, delivery must occur quickly. A mother who is already in labor is monitored closely and may expect to give birth vaginally if she and the fetus remain stable. In the case of heavy bleeding, a cesarean section is performed immediately. Before or after delivery, the mother may require a blood transfusion if she experiences severe blood loss. Each of these conditions can lead to a cesarean section. Continue reading to find out more about this extremely safe procedure.

See more Photo courtesy Anita Patterson/ During fertilization, the sperm undertake a long and perilous journey into the body. Their quest is to cross the cervix before they die. Out of millions of sperm, only one will fertilize the egg. Once that one sperm crosses the threshold, an entirely new journey begins. For the next 40 weeks or so, the mother's body will undergo a series of transformations as it nourishes and houses a new life. The egg will also transform -- from a tiny mass of into a living, breathing baby. In this article, we'll look inside the womb to learn how the during each trimester of the pregnancy, see how the baby finally makes its way into the world, and find out what could go wrong during pregnancy. ­­Starting a family is a big decision -- planning ahead is important. Health experts recommend that women who are trying to conceive see their doctor or () for a pre-pregnancy examination, to make sure that their body is up to the task. Take medical history to determine whether the woman has a history of any disease (such as or high blood pressure) that might be dangerous during the pregnancy Get family history and peform genetic testing to identify any hereditary disorders Perform a health screening, including an examination for infections such as herpes and other or Check to make sure the mother-to-be is up to date on all of her immunizations, especially rubella, which can cause or birth defects Women who are trying to conceive should watch their diet and take daily . Taking at least 400 micrograms of each day can significantly protect against birth defects. They should also stop , because it can lead to low birth weight and other complications. Next, let's review what happens during conception and the first trimester. The fertilized egg makes the journey through the Fallopian tube to the uterus, where it will implant. A releases millions of sperm with each ejaculation. Once inside the body, the sperm make a mad dash to find the egg. If one sperm reaches the egg and penetrates it, occurs. Some women know immediately that they're pregnant -- call it a new mother's intuition. However, the only way to know for sure is to take a pregnancy test. All look for the same thing: the presence of (hCG), a hormone produced only during pregnancy. Home pregnancy tests measure hCG in urine, while a test in the doctor's office will identify hCG in a sample The blood test can pick up very tiny amounts of the hormone and identify pregnancy earlier than a home pregnancy test. Still, most home tests are 97 to 99 percent accurate if taken correctly. Then things start progressing rapidly inside the mother's womb. The sperm and egg merge to form a little single-celled organism called a , which consists of the 23 chromosomes from the man's sperm and the 23 chromosomes from the female's egg. These chromosomes will determine the baby's hair color, eye color and whether the baby will be a boy or a girl. Soon after fertilization, the zygote makes the trip through the Fallopian tubes to the uterus. During this journey, the zygote divides. Within 72 hours, it will have gone from one to eight cells. Remember the zygote? This little ball of cells divides until it contains about 100 cells. Then it becomes known as a . The inner group of cells will form the . The outer group of cells forms the placenta, which will provide nourishment. Three weeks into the pregnancy, the blastocyst implants itself into the mother's uterine wall and releases hCG. This occurs only a few days after conception. Her doctor will begin counting the 40 weeks of pregnancy from the start of her last period, although conception normally occurs about two weeks after that. By the fifth week of the pregnancy, the , spinal cord, , and other organs begin to form. The embryo is now made up of three layers: the , , and . Every organ and tissue will develop out of these three layers. The ectoderm will form the nervous system and backbone; the mesoderm will form the heart and circulatory system; and the endoderm will form the , gastrointestinal tract, thyroid, liver and pancreas. The placenta has already begun to form, as well as the umbilical cord, which will deliver nutrients to -- and remove wastes from -- the growing embryo. Next, we'll look at the rest of the first trimester. About 10 percent of reproductive-age couples in the U.S. suffer from , which occurs when one or both partners has a problem with their reproductive system that makes conception difficult or impossible []. A couple is said to be infertile when they have had without using birth control for more than a year without conceiving. I­n about 40 percent of infertility cases, the problem lies with the partner. ­In another 40 percent, the problem lies with the female, and the remaining 20 percent are caused by either a combination of both partners or some unexplained problem []. Fortunately, there are several methods for treating infertility, including in-vitro fertilization and medication. Even though the embryo is still the size of a sesame seed, the -to-be will probably start feeling the first twinges of pregnancy. Morning sickness, frequent urination, sleepiness, and cravings or aversions are all common. Her breasts may swell and become tender. Some women start to put on weight, but others actually lose weight from morning sickness. At this point in the pregnancy, the woman will have her first prenatal Ob/Gyn visit. By the fifth week, an may be able to pick up a . The mother needs to be especially careful during this first trimester, during the formation of the delicate organs. Pregnant women should avoid , certain medications, , and smoking. They should also continue to take prenatal vitamins containing , eat a healthy diet and regularly. Between 9 and 12 weeks, women over age 35 and those who have a family history of chromosomal abnormalities will probably have a (CVS). This test detects Down syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities. Using an to guide him, the doctor will remove a small piece of placental tissue and test it for these conditions. In the last few weeks of the first trimester, the embryo really starts to take shape. The facial structures begin to form and become recognizable. The , which will form the and spinal cord, develops. Little buds emerge and grow into arms and legs. Around week 8, the embryo becomes a . The kidneys, liver, brain, and lungs are all beginning to function. The fingers and toes are separate and the external genitalia are formed. At 12 weeks, the fetus is about three inches long and weighs about one ounce. At the end of the first trimester, many pregnant women find that their clothes are getting tight, although they may not yet be ready for maternity clothes. In the next section, we'll discuss what happens during the second trimester. About 15 percent of pregnancies end in -- most within the first trimester []. As many as 50 percent of pregnancies may end in miscarriage, but most occur so early that the woman did not even realize that she was pregnant. Most pregnancies end because of a , a problem with either the egg or the sperm. Women who are over the age of 35 are at greater risk for these abnormalities -- and at greater risk of having a miscarriage -- than younger women. Other causes of miscarriage are infections, hormonal problems, or an illness or disease (such as ). Drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes, and taking certain drugs can also increase the risk. Fortunately, most women who have a miscarriage can go on to have a healthy, problem-free pregnancy in the future. For many , the second trimester is a definite improvement. As the nausea recedes and exhaustion abates, many women feel better and have more energy -- and appetite -- during this period. However, some women develop other unpleasant symptoms, such as . Other changes occur in the mother's body. Even though her is just a few inches long, her belly is growing. Mammary ducts inside her breasts prepare to produce milk. During this trimester, the mother's breasts will start to produce a yellowish, nutrient-rich substance called , which will during its first few days of life. Inside her womb, the rapid activity continues. Although the mother may not be able to feel it yet, the fetus now kicks and moves. Its head -- which just a few weeks ago dwarfed the rest of its body -- is now more proportional. A fine hair called covers its body. The kidneys and urinary tract start to produce urine and release it into the amniotic fluid. The liver begins secreting bile, and the spleen begins to aid in the production of red cells. By week 15, the fetus is around five inches long and weighs about two ounces. Although its eyelids are fused shut, its are now sensitive to . The mother will make her second prenatal doctor visit between weeks 12 and 16 of her pregnancy. At this visit, her Ob/Gyn may perform an to look at the baby. Sometimes the doctor can determine the sex during this visit. The doctor will probably also measure the -- the distance between the top of the mother's pubic bone and the top of her uterus. This measurement will allow the doctor to track the fetus' growth throughout the pregnancy. Tests done during this trimester include an (AFP) or triple test -- a blood test that detects levels of alpha-fetoprotein (a protein produced in the fetus's liver) to identify Down syndrome or spina bifida. If the mother is over age 35, she might also have an , a procedure in which the doctor inserts a thin needle into her abdomen and removes a small sample of amniotic fluid to test for birth defects and chromosomal abnormalities. Between weeks 16 and 20, the fetus begins to and may even be able to hear the sound of its mother's voice. It can frown, squint, and make other facial expressions. The fetus' scalp is sprouting tiny hair buds, its skeleton is hardening, and millions of tiny neurons in its brain help its move. Its tiny pumps about 25 quarts of blood each day. Its reproductive organs are forming. If the fetus is a girl, her ovaries are beginning to produce the millions of eggs that she will possess for her entire lifetime. During this period, the mother may start to experience ""quickening"" -- feeling her tiny fetus kick. The mother's body continues to undergo numerous changes. Often, pregnant women appear to ""glow."" Although many women are truly suffused with the joy of pregnancy, the glow is often due to increased blood flow to the face. Many women also have a dark line running from their belly button to their pubic bone. This line, called , occurs because of an increase in pigmentation, or . It should disappear shortly after the baby is born. Some women also develop stretch marks -- thin pink or brown lines on their belly which often fade soon after the baby is born. Another common problem is , swelling of the ankles and feet due to fluid retention. Severe swelling in the hands and face could be a sign of a potentially dangerous condition called , which prevents the placenta from getting enough blood. At week 20 -- halfway through the pregnancy -- the is about six inches long and weighs about 10 ounces. Its digestive system produces , a black, tar-like substance that will make up its first few bowel movements. The fetus is coated in a white greasy substance called , which will protect its skin from the amniotic fluid in utero. To train its digestive system and , the fetus will swallow and ""breathe"" amniotic fluid. Its lungs produce a substance called , which will enable the air sacs to inflate for breathing once it is born. At this point in the pregnancy, the may develop because of her skin's increased oil production. She may also develop varicose veins, which are caused when valves malfunction and allow to pool in the legs. Other changes include larger breasts, skin discoloration, heartburn and constipation. Nasal congestion is common as more blood flows through the mucous membranes, and the mother's legs may cramp as her uterus puts pressure on veins. Some mothers are more prone to bladder infections due to hormonal changes. Between 24 and 28 weeks, the Ob/Gyn will perform a glucose screening test to check the mother for , a form of in which the mother does not produce enough insulin. If she does have gestational diabetes, she will have to control her blood sugar with diet and may need insulin injections. may also become apparent during this time. Mothers with this condition have a placenta that hangs low in the uterus and blocks the cervical opening to the birth canal. If placenta previa continues into late pregnancy, the mother will have to deliver by . Week 27 marks the end of the second trimester. By now, the fetus has grown to about 14 inches long, and weighs about 2 pounds. It is already starting to look like a newborn baby. If born at this point, the baby may survive, but would face potentially serious problems. We'll look at the changes that take place during the third trimester next. During the next 12 weeks, the will finish its development and prepare for the difficult . It is now about 15 inches long and weighs between two and three pounds. Its are a definite color (although they may change after it is born) and are fringed with lashes. Its body is rounding out as deposits under its skin. This fat will help its body regulate temperature once it is born. Its brain is becoming larger and more defined, and its skull is growing to accommodate it. If it is a , his testicles are descending into his scrotum. If the fetus is a , her clitoris is developed. As the mother's belly swells, she may be in more discomfort, especially near the end of her pregnancy. She might experience hemorrhoids and insomnia. The pressure of the growing uterus on her diaphragm may also make her feel short of breath. It can press down on nerves, causing pain in her lower back and legs, and constrict her bladder, making her run to the bathroom constantly. Many women feel tired and have difficulty because of their increasing girth. Sometime during the third trimester, the of the mother's uterus begin contracting. These are practice to help the mother's body prepare for labor. Frequent or painful contractions could be a sign of premature labor. By week 32, the fetus can move its eyes back and forth and tell the difference between light and dark. It is gaining weight quickly -- about a half pound per week. At this stage in the pregnancy, the fetus weighs just over four pounds and measures 15 to 17 inches long. It may have a full head of hair as well as fingernails and toenails. The mother's uterus is getting very crowded. Although the fetus continues to move, its movements won't be as fervent as they were earlier in the pregnancy. At week 35, the fetus measures between 15 and 18 inches long and weighs five-and-a-half to 6 pounds. The lanugo starts to fall off. The vernix caseosa, which protected its body in the amniotic fluid, also disappears. Its organs are almost fully developed. From this point on, the mother will probably visit her doctor every week until the baby is born. The doctor may do a culture of the mother's vagina to test for bacteria called , or Group B strep. Mothers who test positive for this bacteria will get intravenous during labor to reduce their risk of passing the infection to their baby during labor. By this point in the pregnancy, the fetus has probably rotated so that it is head down in preparation for birth. Babies that are turned the wrong way are called deliveries, but there are ways of turning the baby before labor begins. As her baby drops lower in her pelvis, the mother may feel relief from the breathlessness and other symptoms that have plagued her for the last few weeks. Although delivery is still a few weeks away, at week 37 the fetus is considered . This means that if it were delivered now, it would be able to function outside the womb. It should weigh at least 6 pounds and measure between 19 and 20 inches. At any time between now and the onset of labor, the mucus plug which had blocked the entrance to the mother's cervix to prevent bacteria from entering will come out. This is a sign that labor is on its way. In the last few weeks of pregnancy, the mother's doctor will check to see how far she has ""effaced"" or ""ripened."" is the process by which the cervix softens and thins to prepare for delivery. When the mother is 100-percent effaced, she is almost ready for labor. Week 40 officially marks the end of the pregnancy, but only a small percentage of women actually deliver on their due date -- many are either early or late. If the baby has still not been delivered by week 41 or 42, the doctor will probably induce labor. If you are carrying low, the baby is a boy. If you are carrying high, it's a girl. The fetus' position in the mother's abdomen bears no relation to its sex. There are only two ways to find out if you're having a girl or a boy: amniocentesis or . If you have heartburn often during pregnancy, your baby will be born with a lot of hair. Heartburn is common to all pregnant women, whether their baby is born bald or with a full head of hair. Spicy (or a particular dish) will cause labor. There is no evidence that any type of food -- no matter how spicy -- can trigger labor. Although sex might be uncomfortable as the mother's tummy grows, no research indicates that it will trigger premature labor. However, if the mother is bleeding during pregnancy, or if her partner has a , her doctor may advise her against having intercourse until the baby is born. If the mother holds her arms above her head, the umbilical cord will strangle the baby. Although a very small percentage of babies are born with the umbilical cord wrapped around their necks, the placement of the cord has absolutely nothing to do with the way the mother holds her arms. In movies, pregnant experience a dramatic rush of fluid as their water breaks. But in reality, very few women will have their water ""break"" (which is actually the breaking of the amniotic sac). Most of the time, the nurse or midwife will break the amniotic sac once labor has already begun. Contractions that increase in frequency, duration, and intensity Cervical dilation (opening up), revealed during a pelvic examination A mother has many options when it comes to . She can deliver in a hospital or birthing center with the help of an obstetrician or midwife, or at home with the help of a midwife. She can also hire a -- a trained professional who offers support during the birthing process. Doctors recommend that women with high-risk pregnancies deliver in a hospital, because medical facilities are best equipped to handle emergencies should they occur. The labor process typically consists of several stages. During , the mother will feel the first contractions. Her cervix will gradually efface and dilate in preparation for delivery. The contractions will be more frequent and become more painful. For many women, the early stage of labor can last for hours, and doesn't necessarily require an immediate trip to the hospital. The contractions come more frequently during . They are also more painful -- sometimes too painful for the mother to talk through. Once the contractions start coming about every five minutes for an hour, the mother should call her doctor and get ready to go to the hospital. The mother's cervix continues to ripen -- it must stretch from about three centimeters to the full 10 centimeters before delivery can begin. Once she reaches the hospital and is dilated sufficiently, the mother can have medication for her pain if she chooses to do so. Options include an ( injected into the woman's spinal cord, which blocks sensation in her lower body) and an intravenous pain reliever. In the stage, the cervix reaches its full dilation as contractions become stronger and even more frequent. They may come every three minutes and last up to a minute each. The baby is also descending into the birth canal in preparation for delivery. As the baby moves down, the mother may feel pressure (as if she needs to have a bowel movement), and an urge to push. This stage may last anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours. Labor typically progresses more slowly for first-time moms. Once her cervix is completely dilated, the is ready to start pushing. The combined force of her pushes and uterine contractions move the baby down the birth canal. Eventually the baby's head will make its way down to the mother's (the tissue that stretches between the vagina and rectum). Pressure on the perineum can be intense, and feel like burning or stinging when the baby ""crowns,"" or when the widest part of its head becomes visible. A procedure called an involves cutting the perineum to make more room for the baby and prevent the vagina from tearing. Although this procedure used to be routine, it's not done very often anymore. Sometimes the vagina tears by itself as the baby passes through. When the baby's head finally emerges completely, the doctor or midwife will suction out its nose and mouth and check to make sure that the umbilical cord is not wrapped around its neck. With another push or two, the baby's body should be out. The doctor, nurse or midwife will dry the baby off with a towel, finish suctioning out its mouth, and clamp the umbilical cord. Sometimes doctors allow the mother's partner or another family member or friend to cut the cord. Click on the play button to see the progression of vaginal delivery. If the animation above isn't working, to get the Shockwave player. Although the baby is out, labor is not quite over. The mother still needs to deliver the placenta, but it usually takes no more than one quick push. After the placenta is out, her uterus will continue to contract to seal off the vessels where the placenta was attached. If the birth is not progressing well, or if either the mother or baby's health is in jeopardy, the doctor may perform a , or c-section. An anesthesiologist numbs the mother from the waist down with an epidural or spinal , and the doctor makes an incision in the mother's abdomen, just above the pubic bone. He opens the uterus, drains the amniotic fluid and removes the baby. Unless there are complications, the baby is treated in much the same way as he is following a vaginal delivery. Typically after a few days in the hospital, the parents can bring home their new bundle of joy! For more information on pregnancy and related topics, check out the links on the next page.

7d07427e-5ad0-4ccd-ad36-5804e9299c84,"A baby is born by C-section in Kabul, Afghanistan, in October 2007. We have all -- hopefully -- learned by now how babies are made, but do you know how they are delivered? The answer depends on the health of the mother and the baby. Delivery options can change, and sometimes very quickly. Vaginal birth is the traditional method, but Cesarean sections, or C-sections, are becoming more commonplace. In a C-section, cut directly into the mother's uterus to deliver the baby. C-section references date back to the first century, with mentions in ancient texts from Egypt, Greece, Rome and other parts of Europe. In ancient times, C-sections were used to cut the baby from the womb if the mother died in childbirth -- it wasn't until the 1500s that a mother reportedly survived a C-section. In the mid-1800s, the first successful C-section was performed in the British Empire. With the rapid development of medical procedures -- including -- in the late 1800s, C-sections became a little less risky and were used to avoid . When a baby couldn't be born vaginally, doctors would perform a craniotomy, which involved destroying the skull of the fetus and removing the remaining parts of the body through the vagina. C-sections were certainly a better alternative, but they still weren't considered safe, with many dying of infection and loss. But doctors continued to refine the technique, and their use has increased steadily since the 1940s. In 2005, nearly 30 percent of women in the United States gave birth via C-section, up from just 6 percent in 1970 [source: ]. In fact, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the C-section rate has increased more than 45 percent since 1996 [source: ]. In this article, we'll learn more about C-sections and how they're performed. We'll also find out why the rate is climbing. What does this mean for women and their babies? What kinds of and labor complications can lead to a C-section, and why do some women plan to have them? Nearly 30 percent of women in the United States gave birth by C-section in 2005. C-sections are now considered routine procedures, with a low chance of mortality for mother and child. have used several C-section techniques over the years, but there are two that are most widely used today. The most common type is a , also known as a . Doctors usually prefer this method because of its lower incidence of loss and other complications like infections. The surgeon makes an incision across the mother's belly, usually about 1 to 2 centimeters above the pre- upper border of the bladder, or the top of the bikini line. The doctor will then cut through the tissues that lie above the uterus. After these tissues and the abdominal have been separated, the doctor makes a horizontal incision in the lower section of the uterus. The baby's amniotic fluid is then suctioned off for more room during delivery. After this step, the doctor usually can pull the baby out without complication or use forceps or a vacuum extractor if he needs extra help. The other type of C-section may sound familiar to an older generation of . The is the procedure that leaves women with a large vertical scar across their belly. The doctor makes a vertical incision and cuts through tissue, and muscle to reach the uterus, where he makes another a vertical incision. Doctors used this technique in the past to give more room for delivery. But they later realized that there were less complications (and a better-placed scar) if the delivery space were reduced. Today, this method is reserved for specific cases, such as an extremely premature baby. The classic C-section is the best choice in this scenario because the lower part of the uterus doesn't thin out until later in pregnancy. The upper part of the uterus is thinner, so doctors must access the baby that way. Women who have gone through a classic C-section are usually not able to deliver any future children vaginally due to a high risk of uterine rupture. Before either procedure, the mother is prepped and given pain medication. This usually comes in the form of an epidural, which numbs the mother from the abdomen down but leaves her awake for the birth of her child. In the operating room, the mother is covered with surgical drapes that block her view of the surgery. She'll probably have a catheter inserted into her bladder. The mother's husband or partner can accompany her in most situations -- after undergoing a quick wardrobe change into surgical attire. After delivery, doctors remove the placenta and use dissolving stitches to sew up the incision. Some underlying tissue and muscle will be able to reattach on its own within a few days without any scars. Doctors then close the skin with stitches or staples. This entire closing process usually takes about 30 minutes, more with a classic C-section incision. That's what happens when a C-section goes as planned -- but they don't always go smoothly. We'll discuss the most common complications for both mother and baby in the next section. Doctors perform a C-section in Kabul, Afghanistan, in October 2007. One out of nine Afghan women die during pregnancy or soon after. C-sections are relatively safe, but they are major surgery. So, by definition, they are riskier than vaginal deliveries. All surgeries involve the risk of infection, complications from , internal injuries, postoperative adhesions and hemorrhaging. Today, maternal deaths in the United States range anywhere from 6 to 22 per every 100,000 births, with the higher rates usually involving emergency C-sections [source: ]. However, these numbers can be a bit misleading. Many have C-sections because of medical conditions, and complications from that condition -- not from the surgery -- are more often the cause of the death. About 25 to 50 percent of C-section deaths are directly attributable to the actual operation [source: ]. After a C-section, the uterine tissues become infected in nearly 40 percent of women. This complication, , is 20 times more likely after a C-section than after a vaginal delivery. Incision infection occurs in anywhere between 2.5 and 15 percent of women. are a common risk, affecting as many as 16 percent of C-section patients. These infections, usually a result of the urinary catheter, can be treated with . Decreased or absent bowel function can also occur, which is usually caused by pre- and postsurgery narcotics. Another serious risk is clotting. These clots are found in 1 out of every 400 pregnancies, regardless of delivery. However, the risk is as much as five times greater after a C-section [source: ]. C-sections can also put the mother at risk during subsequent births. Complications include preterm birth, breech presentation and low birth weight, with the major risk being a . This rupture can involve a small tear (with minimal complications) or a large one that results in the fetus and placenta pouring into the abdominal cavity. This happens when the incision scar expands and tears during or labor, and it can cause the mother to need a blood transfusion and possibly a -- and the baby could die from lack of oxygen. It's certainly a serious complication, but the actual risk can be as low as 1 percent when the previous C-section was a low transverse incision. It increases to 4 to 10 percent with a classic C-section [source: ]. So, often advise women not to opt for vaginal delivery after having had a C-section. The risks increase with each C-section -- one of the most common is . This happens when the placenta, which provides nourishment to the fetus during pregnancy, is attached too deeply to the uterine wall. The risk gets higher with each C-section because scar tissue can build up in the uterus. Another risk that increases with recurring C-sections is the need for emergency hysterectomies at delivery. The chance of hysterectomy increases five times with the fourth C-section and is nearly 20 times greater in women with six or more C-sections [source: ]. can also occur with multiple C-sections. This occurs when the placenta develops low in the uterus, blocking the cervix and possibly causing a need for another C-section. Mom is not the only one who faces risks with C-sections. Babies born by C-section can suffer from -- breathing problems in the first few days of life that usually call for treatment with oxygen therapy. This occurs in 12 to 35 per 1,000 C-section babies -- compared to 5.3 per 1,000 vaginal births [source: ]. When a baby is born vaginally, pressure on the lungs pushes out excess fluid. That doesn't happen in a C-section, so these babies sometimes have trouble breathing. Doctors use the Apgar scale to quickly assess a baby's health immediately after birth -- they rate the baby's skin color, heart rate, reflexes, muscle tone and respiration on a scale of one to 10. Babies who are delivered by C-section often have low scores, usually because of the breathing problems mentioned above, along with the sedation medication given to the mother (and therefore baby), which can make the child lethargic. These sedatives can also make it hard to breast-feed at first. Finally, a rare but serious risk is injury to the fetus from the surgical incisions. Even with these risks, sometimes doctors and patients plan C-sections. But many C-sections are unplanned -- performed in emergency situations. We'll find out more about unplanned C-sections next. Most unplanned C-sections are emergency surgeries, which means they are performed after labor has begun, when the health of the mother or child is at risk. This can happen for a number of reasons. , which is indicated by a dramatic change in the baby's rate. This is one of the most common reasons for an emergency C-section. occurs when the placenta prematurely separates from the uterine wall. This can cause excessive bleeding in the mother and decreased oxygen supply for the baby, both of which can result in death. During a vaginal delivery, there can be . The cord can wrap around the baby's neck and cut off oxygen supply. It can also slip out of the birth canal before the baby, which can result in a lack of supply. could also necessitate an unplanned C-section. Labor could stop progressing for several reasons, including -- when the infant's head is too large for the mother's pelvic structure. A could result in a C-section if it could be passed on to the child through vaginal delivery. For example, a mother with can deliver vaginally, as long as she's not suffering from an outbreak. But if she is having an outbreak when her water breaks or during delivery, the baby is will be delivered via C-section. C-sections are unavoidable in some situations, but what would make a or mother choose one if there's no emergency? That's what we'll discuss in the next section. This one certainly falls into the ""unplanned"" category. In 2000, a Mexican woman with no medical training gave herself a C-section. Ines Ramirez came to fame when an article in the International Journal of Gynecology and Obstetrics described her amazing self-performed surgery. Ramirez was alone at home -- with no phone -- when labor pains started. After nearly 12 hours of labor, she was concerned for the baby’s life, so she found a 6-inch knife, gulped some rubbing alcohol and began to cut through her skin and muscles using a diagonal line across her belly. After about an hour, she was able to reach inside to pull her baby free and remembers cutting the umbilical cord with scissors before passing out. One of the village’s medical assistants managed to close her nearly 7-inch incision, and Ramirez was then loaded into the back of a pickup truck for the eight-hour drive to the nearest hospital. Unlike many women who have C-sections in the hospital, Mrs. Ramirez did not suffer from any infections and left the hospital only four days later. Babies born by C-section, like this quadruplet in China, can be at risk for complications. Planned C-sections are scheduled well before labor begins. There are two subgroups: indication-based and patient-requested. are usually scheduled at the 's request when a patient suffers from, or is at great risk of, a medical problem that could result in labor that would harm her or the baby. When a child is in the breech (feet-down) position, vaginal delivery is dangerous. Large babies (more than 9 pounds) are often delivered by planned C-section. Mothers who suffer from chronic conditions that could be exacerbated by labor, like or , often plan C-sections. Multiple births, which are more common these days because of the increased use of fertility medications, are usually an indication for a C-section. The doctor will opt for a C-section when there are three or more fetuses in the womb, or when are conjoined or sharing one amniotic sac. Women who have had previous C-sections will often have a planned C-section. One of the advantages of a planned C-section is the assurance that you will be at the hospital during peak hours, when a full staff is working. The risks of a planned C-section are also lower than those of an emergency operation. (planned, without medical indications) are a growing trend in the United States. The National Institute of Health estimates that, in 2004, 4 to 18 percent of C-sections were performed on maternal request instead of for medical reasons [source: ]. While the NIH has admitted that these numbers are difficult to validate, they are sure that this type of C-section is becoming more and more common. We know that the risks of C-sections are greater than risks of vaginal birth, at least with your first pregnancy. So why are opting for C-sections, even for their first birth? Some theorize that the combination of improved C-section safety, along with increased maternal age, has lead to women being able to control when and how they are going to give birth. This type of control is attractive to women who are balancing family and career -- they can perfectly plan maternity leave, right down to the date of the last . Another popular theory is that some women, fearing the pain of vaginal delivery and wanting to avoid urinary incontinence, jump at the chance to give birth via C-section. Whatever the reasoning, doctors are quick to point out that women should not make this decision lightly. One C-section increases the necessity for another with the next child -- and the risk of serious complications increases for subsequent C-sections. The has guidelines for patient-requested C-sections. To ensure proper fetal lung maturity, they should not be scheduled before 39 weeks of . If a delivery is scheduled before this time the fetus' maturity must be verified before delivery. No matter the reason, millions of women have C-sections every year. So what should a mom expect after she's been wheeled out of the operating room and into her hospital room? That's what we will discuss in our next section. C-section have a longer recovery period than those who have vaginal births. The average hospital stay after a C-section is longer than for a vaginal birth -- four days after a C-section and only two days after a vaginal delivery. Women who give birth vaginally usually have a one- to two-week recovery time, which stretches to six weeks after a C-section. Vaginal delivery might be more painful, but C-section recovery pain is often intense, and the new mother needs a few weeks to gain full mobility. After a C-section, closely monitor the mother for the first 24 hours and give her pain medication throughout the hospital stay. If surgery went smoothly, after about a day, doctors encourage new moms to walk around to help gas from collecting in the abdomen and clots from forming in the legs. The patient might attempt to breast-feed in the hospital, but babies born via C-section are less likely to be breast-fed than those delivered vaginally. One factor is that the mother will need to sleep and recoup from surgery. So she'll have less time with the baby, especially during the first hour after birth, which is the best time to begin breast-feeding. Also, babies delivered via C-section can be lethargic from the pain medication given to the mother, resulting in a disinterest in learning to breast-feed. Doctors often remove the new mom's staples or stitches before she leaves the hospital. At discharge, they will give extensive information on how to recognize signs of serious complications, such as infection or hemorrhaging. So what about the next delivery? We discussed the risks of multiple C-sections, along with the dangers of vaginal delivery after a C-section, so what's a woman to do? Each woman is different, of course, but vaginal delivery can be perfectly safe after a C-section. In fact, according to the American Pregnancy Association, nearly 90 percent of all women who have had C-sections are candidates for vaginal delivery in a subsequent . Of those who decide on a vaginal delivery, up to 80 percent will have a normal delivery [source: ]. However, of the 80 percent of women who could opt for a vaginal delivery, only about one in 10 actually does. Why is this? Well, as we discussed, there are risks. One is the rupture of the uterus, which can be as high as 1.5 percent [source: ]. Other risks include the reopening of the previous C-section scar, rehospitalization after birth and infertility (which can result from an emergency hysterectomy or from uterine scarring). To avoid these risks, most doctors will do a ""trial labor."" This simply means that the mother begins labor expecting a vaginal birth. She is monitored closely for any complications, and a C-section is an immediate option if needed. Of those women who attempt a vaginal delivery after a C-section, approximately four out of every 10 end up having a C-section [source: ]. A C-section is the safest option if the vaginal delivery is not going well, but the risk of infection doubles. But there are also many benefits to a vaginal delivery. First, no more scars. This is especially important for women who want more children -- the more scars on the uterus, the greater the chance of complications in future pregnancies. Other benefits include less pain during recovery, a shorter recovery, higher chance of successful breast-feeding and a lower risk of infection.

7085de01-8e75-4d15-a2bb-5522e861796a,"MoThere are many possible pregnancy complications that prenatal care can help minimize. Publications International, Ltd. All parents hope and expect to experience a normal pregnancy and take home a healthy child. Although the majority of pregnancies and deliveries are uneventful, some involve complications that range from minor to life threatening -- for the mother, for the baby, or for both. Complications of pregnancy may develop gradually or suddenly and without warning. One objective of prenatal care is the prompt diagnosis and treatment of these complications before they worsen. In this article, we describe the most common complications of pregnancy, their causes and symptoms, and their treatment over the following sections: In recent years there has been a trend toward having babies later in life. But more pronounced chronic diseases in the mother, among other conditions, can have an adverse affect on the developing fetus. Fortunately, prenatal care is similar for women of all ages, but this page will tell you some symptoms that women older than 35 should watch out for. Most teenagers are not ready -- physically or emotionally -- to have children. As a result, birth weight is typically lower and babies of teens are more susceptible to certain illnesses. It will take an effort on the part of the teenage mom to ensure the health of her baby. This page tells you how to do it. About 11 to 12 percent of deliveries in the United States are classified as premature, which is a birth that occurs between the 20th and 36th weeks of pregnancy. This is a dangerous condition for the baby, which might not be able to survive outside of the womb. But modern medicine has helped many premature babies survive and grow up normally. On this page you'll learn why you must go to the hospital immediately if you suspect you're going into labor prematurely. If a baby still has not arrived two weeks past its due date, it may be in danger of malnutrition or even pneumonia. There is no danger to the mother, but a doctor may choose to induce labor for the baby's health. This page will tell you what happens in that case. An ectopic pregnancy is one in which the fertilized egg settles outside the uterus. This can be a very painful, and dangerous, condition for the mother, and if an ectopic pregnancy is detected the mother will be hospitalized immediately. This page will show you how to tell if you have an ectopic pregnancy, and what your doctor will do. Stillbirth, the death of a baby before it is born, is becoming rare thanks to improved prenatal care. However, this tragic outcome of a pregnancy can happen, usually when the flow of nutrition from the placenta is cut off. This page will tell you how a doctor will detect a stillbirth. About 15 percent of known births end in miscarriage, when a baby is born too early in the pregnancy to be viable. Although many doctors prescribe bed rest if they suspect a miscarriage is possible, most believe there is no way to prevent one. This page will tell you the different types of miscarriage and the factors that contribute to them. Twins can double the joy of being a new mother, but they can also present health risks. The most common risk of a multiple birth is premature labor, and a breech birth -- with the baby coming out feet first rather than head first -- is common as well. Although the reasons for multiple births are not fully understood, this page will tell you what do to if you're carrying more than one fetus. A woman shouldn't experience any vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. If you do, it may be a sign of placenta previa or placental abruption. These are two conditions in which the placenta does not behave normally, and they almost always lead to a cesarean section. Find out more about these abnormalities on this page. About 30 percent of U.S. babies are born via cesarean section, in which a baby is removed through an incision in the mother's abdomen. There are many reasons why this procedure would be necessary, but it's always for the health of the baby or the mother and it's extremely safe. This page goes over the reasons and explains the two types of cesarean section. Birth defects can affect the head, face, eyes, mouth, hands, feet, and internal organs. Some minor birth defects can be corrected and leave no trace, but others are more severe and stay with the baby for life. This page details numerous birth defects, from cleft palate and clubfoot to spina bifida and Down syndrome. If a mother and fetus don't have compatible blood, there can be severe complications for the fetus. Furthermore, any fetus the mother carries in the future is at risk, too, unless a doctor takes the proper steps to sensitize the mother. Find out what Rh is, how it affects your pregnancy, and what your doctor will do about it on this page. The baby isn't the only one who's at risk. Pregnancy can cause health issues for the mother too, from simple swelling of the hands and feet to increased risk of heart and kidney disease. And existing conditions in the mother, such as diabetes, can endanger a fetus. Most mothers are healthy throughout their pregnancy, but this page will tell you how to stay that way. Labor is a complicated process that can become difficult in several ways. If the baby and the umbilical cord are not positioned correctly, for example, the doctor may have to perform a cesarean section. Here you'll see what your doctor will be looking for and what he or she will do to correct anything that goes wrong. This information is solely for informational purposes.

628f34e3-7155-48d4-b40f-63fcc82db5e5,"Although the incidence of heart disease among women in their childbearing years has declined dramatically in recent years, it still remains one of the major causes of death in pregnant women. Most women with known heart disease withstand pregnancy without any problems. However, in some cases in which the heart muscle or valves are seriously diseased, the added strain normally placed on the heart during pregnancy may lead to heart failure and even death. For this reason, any woman who knows that she has a heart problem should check with her doctor before attempting to become pregnant. The most common disease of the kidneys during pregnancy is pyelonephritis, a bacterial infection of the kidney. This can occur when an infection of the bladder allows bacteria to travel up to the kidneys. Symptoms include fever, severe low back pain, and chills. It is important to treat pyelonephritis quickly because it may cause a pregnant woman to go into premature labor. All instances of severe low back pain and fever should be reported to the doctor immediately. Women who have severe kidney disease before pregnancy can have many serious problems during pregnancy. Extremely high blood pressure and kidney failure (inability to produce urine) are life-threatening complications for both the mother and the fetus. Some women with severe kidney disease may be advised not to become pregnant. Consult your doctor if you have any questions. Before the discovery of insulin for the treatment of diabetes, women with diabetes who became pregnant either miscarried or the pregnancy resulted in the death of the mother and baby. Today, a diabetic woman can expect to deliver a healthy, normal baby. Even though medical care of the diabetic woman has improved greatly in the last decade, a variety of serious problems may be associated with pregnancy, including an increased chance of preeclampsia, stillbirth, and abnormally small babies. For these reasons, it is important for a diabetic woman to achieve excellent glucose control prior to conception to decrease her risks for complications associated with pregnancy. Once pregnant, the diabetic woman should expect more frequent prenatal office visits and more laboratory testing. It is important for her to maintain a strict diet, exercise appropriately, and take her insulin at all the prescribed times. Another form of diabetes -- called gestational, or pregnancy-induced, diabetes -- affects women only during pregnancy. In this disorder, women who were not diabetic before pregnancy display signs of diabetes only when they are pregnant. During routine prenatal office visits, the pregnant woman's urine is always tested for the presence of sugar, or glucose (urine should normally contain no glucose). If sugar appears in the urine, the doctor performs a blood test to see if the woman's blood sugar level is abnormally high. In addition, most physicians now routinely perform a blood test called a glucose challenge test at 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy, even if urine tests have been normal. If the results show elevated levels, a more complex test is done to confirm the diagnosis. Women with pregnancy-induced diabetes are generally treated with a special diet that restricts their intake of sugar and carbohydrates. Insulin is sometimes necessary to bring the blood sugar level down to normal. Since women with pregnancy-induced diabetes also are at a greater risk for preeclampsia and stillbirth, they can expect to have more frequent prenatal visits. These women are also at risk of having macrosomic, or very large, babies. About 30 to 40 percent of women who develop gestational diabetes go on to develop nongestational diabetes several years after pregnancy. Postpartum weight control can help reduce this risk. The most common digestive system problem affecting pregnant women is hyperemesis gravidarum. In this condition, the woman suffers excessive or abnormal vomiting. This vomiting is more severe than that caused by normal ""morning sickness,"" which usually clears up on its own within a few months. In hyperemesis gravidarum, the vomiting leads to starvation, loss of water in the body, and an imbalance in bodily fluids. Symptoms include weight loss and dehydration. The condition is most often treated in the hospital through the use of antivomiting drugs and intravenous feeding. A pregnant woman should not attempt to treat herself with drugs for vomiting without first consulting her doctor. Lung disease is uncommon in pregnant women with the exception of occasional bouts of cough and congestion associated with the flu or a cold. The most serious lung disease to affect a pregnant woman is asthma. In women who have only mild asthma attacks before pregnancy, their asthma may stay the same, improve, or worsen. In women with severe asthma before pregnancy, symptoms usually worsen during pregnancy. Women with severe asthma are also more likely to have premature labor and small babies. Before a woman with severe asthma attempts to become pregnant, she should consult her doctor. Fatty liver disease and HELLP syndrome, both of which affect the liver, are rare. Fatty liver disease is generally associated with preeclampsia and occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. The cause is unknown, but symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Liver failure may result. HELLP syndrome (which is named after its characteristics: Hemolysis, a breakdown of red blood cells; Elevated Liver enzymes; and a Low Platelet count) is a severe form of preeclampsia and is, in part, characterized by liver inflammation. If a woman knows she has liver disease, she should check with her doctor before attempting to become pregnant. The most common nervous system problem in a pregnant woman is headache, generally caused by tension, migraine, or an infection of the sinuses or throat. Simple measures, such as lying down in a quiet room and applying ice packs over the forehead, relieve most simple headaches. However, since a headache may be a symptom of high blood pressure associated with preeclampsia, all severe or persistent headaches should be reported to the doctor immediately. Numbness and tingling of the fingers, thighs, and toes are quite common in pregnancy and usually result from retention of water and swelling. Epilepsy is the most serious nervous system problem that can affect a pregnant woman. About half of women with epilepsy experience worsening of symptoms during pregnancy. Furthermore, certain drugs commonly used to treat epilepsy may cause birth defects in the baby. Before a woman with epilepsy attempts to become pregnant, she should check with her doctor. Several types of skin changes are common in pregnant women and result from the normal hormonal changes of pregnancy. Darkening of the skin is common, especially on the face, abdomen, vulva, thighs, and around the nipples. As pregnancy progresses, the palms of the hands often become red, and small spider veins may develop on the arms and face. Stretch marks on the skin of the lower part of the abdomen usually develop late in pregnancy. Several types of skin diseases occur only in pregnancy. These appear as numerous small, raised bumps that are usually extremely itchy. Though these conditions are rarely serious, report any unusual skin changes or itching to your doctor.

7cc27ea7-6196-4438-a05a-661cb7bf16d5,"As complicated as labor is, there are a number of situations that can arise that would present a danger to the mother, the baby, or both. The baby and the umbilical cord must be correcting positioned in the birth canal throughout the process for a healthy delivery. While a condition as mild as slow labor can be easily corrected with medicine, several other complications are more severe. The remedy for many of these complications is birth by cesarean section. Labor is defined as the process by which the uterus rhythmically contracts and expels the baby and placenta. Labor is a progressive process that generally does not stop until the baby and placenta have been delivered. For a woman pregnant with her first child, the average length of time from the beginning of labor to the delivery of the baby is about 14 hours; for a woman with at least one previous delivery, it is about 8 hours. During a woman's labor, the doctor examines the cervix periodically (about every two hours) to determine how far it has dilated (widened). Before labor begins, the cervix is closed. When the cervix is fully dilated, it has reached 10 centimeters in diameter (there are 2.54 centimeters per inch). At this point, the baby's head has enough room to move into the vagina and be delivered. The nurse or doctor also checks the baby's heartbeat during labor. Sometimes a special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be used. More commonly today, hospitals use an electronic fetal monitor. With this device, a special microphone is placed on the mother's abdomen above the uterus and secured with a strap. This microphone is connected to the fetal monitor, which amplifies the sound of the heartbeat and records the heart rate on a moving strip of paper. The baby's heart rate during labor is normally in the range of 110 to 160 beats per minute. Another function of the fetal monitor is to record the mother's labor contractions. A special pressure-sensing device is secured to the abdomen with a strap and then connected to the monitor. Each time a labor contraction occurs, it shows up on the monitor paper as a short wave. By watching the monitor, the nurses and the doctor can tell how frequently the mother is having contractions. Some women may experience abnormally slow labor, which is usually caused by mild or infrequent contractions. The doctor can detect this by looking at the fetal monitor and noting that the cervix is dilating slowly. The usual treatment of slow labor is to give the drug oxytocin (Pitocin) intravenously. Oxytocin speeds up labor contractions and causes them to become stronger. In some cases, the mother may have been in labor for many hours without giving birth. The doctor's examination usually shows that either the cervix has stopped dilating or the baby is still high up in the mother's pelvis. In medical terms, this problem is called failure to progress. Failure to progress is usually caused by one of two problems: either the baby is too large to fit through the mother's pelvic bones or the mother's pelvic bones are too small to allow the delivery of even a normal-size baby. Since in many cases of failure to progress the baby cannot fit through the pelvis, cesarean section is necessary to ensure a safe delivery. The umbilical cord is the attachment between the fetus and the placenta. It literally forms the lifeline of the fetus through which it obtains oxygen and nutrients from the mother. During labor, a portion of the umbilical cord may prolapse (fall down) into the vagina before the baby is delivered. If this occurs, the umbilical cord may become compressed between the fetal head and the walls of the mother's pelvis, thereby cutting off the blood supply to the fetus. Unless a vaginal delivery is expected to occur immediately, cesarean section must be performed to save the baby's life. During labor, the fetal heart rate is normally steady. In some situations, however, there may be a decrease, or deceleration, of the heart rate during uterine contractions. Compression of the fetal head against the wall of the mother's pelvis may give a particular pattern of deceleration that is quite normal, especially during the latter parts of labor. Serious causes of fetal heart rate deceleration include problems with the placenta and a compressed or pinched-off umbilical cord. Since these decelerations may mean that the fetus is not getting enough oxygen, immediate delivery of the baby -- usually by means of cesarean section -- is necessary. The range of complications that can have severe repurcussions on a mother and baby may seem like they make pregnancy a scary time. But most pregnancies are normal and healthy, and hospitals are well equipped to handle most adverse situations. Knowing what to do in the unlikely event something does go wrong will help you delivery a strong, healthy baby. Excessive bleeding or hemorrhage is a serious complication of labor and is usually caused by either placenta previa or placental abruption. Immediate cesarean section is usually necessary to save the life of both the mother and baby. It is not healthy or helpful to dwell on what can go wrong during a pregnancy. However, a little knowledge about pregnancy complications can show you that they are rare, often corrected, and an aspect of pregnancy that all parent have to confront. is a practicing obstetrician with her own private practice in New York City.

8fa2b44e-8b34-409c-803a-cd2050a48788,"by Browse the article MoThere are many possible pregnancy complications that prenatal care can help minimize. Publications International, Ltd. All parents hope and expect to experience a normal pregnancy and take home a healthy child. Although the majority of pregnancies and deliveries are uneventful, some involve complications that range from minor to life threatening -- for the mother, for the baby, or for both. Complications of pregnancy may develop gradually or suddenly and without warning. One objective of prenatal care is the prompt diagnosis and treatment of these complications before they worsen. In this article, we describe the most common complications of pregnancy, their causes and symptoms, and their treatment over the following sections: In recent years there has been a trend toward having babies later in life. But more pronounced chronic diseases in the mother, among other conditions, can have an adverse affect on the developing fetus. Fortunately, prenatal care is similar for women of all ages, but this page will tell you some symptoms that women older than 35 should watch out for. Most teenagers are not ready -- physically or emotionally -- to have children. As a result, birth weight is typically lower and babies of teens are more susceptible to certain illnesses. It will take an effort on the part of the teenage mom to ensure the health of her baby. This page tells you how to do it. About 11 to 12 percent of deliveries in the United States are classified as premature, which is a birth that occurs between the 20th and 36th weeks of pregnancy. This is a dangerous condition for the baby, which might not be able to survive outside of the womb. But modern medicine has helped many premature babies survive and grow up normally. On this page you'll learn why you must go to the hospital immediately if you suspect you're going into labor prematurely. If a baby still has not arrived two weeks past its due date, it may be in danger of malnutrition or even pneumonia. There is no danger to the mother, but a doctor may choose to induce labor for the baby's health. This page will tell you what happens in that case. An ectopic pregnancy is one in which the fertilized egg settles outside the uterus. This can be a very painful, and dangerous, condition for the mother, and if an ectopic pregnancy is detected the mother will be hospitalized immediately. This page will show you how to tell if you have an ectopic pregnancy, and what your doctor will do. Stillbirth, the death of a baby before it is born, is becoming rare thanks to improved prenatal care. However, this tragic outcome of a pregnancy can happen, usually when the flow of nutrition from the placenta is cut off. This page will tell you how a doctor will detect a stillbirth. About 15 percent of known births end in miscarriage, when a baby is born too early in the pregnancy to be viable. Although many doctors prescribe bed rest if they suspect a miscarriage is possible, most believe there is no way to prevent one. This page will tell you the different types of miscarriage and the factors that contribute to them. Twins can double the joy of being a new mother, but they can also present health risks. The most common risk of a multiple birth is premature labor, and a breech birth -- with the baby coming out feet first rather than head first -- is common as well. Although the reasons for multiple births are not fully understood, this page will tell you what do to if you're carrying more than one fetus. A woman shouldn't experience any vaginal bleeding during pregnancy. If you do, it may be a sign of placenta previa or placental abruption. These are two conditions in which the placenta does not behave normally, and they almost always lead to a cesarean section. Find out more about these abnormalities on this page. About 30 percent of U.S. babies are born via cesarean section, in which a baby is removed through an incision in the mother's abdomen. There are many reasons why this procedure would be necessary, but it's always for the health of the baby or the mother and it's extremely safe. This page goes over the reasons and explains the two types of cesarean section. Birth defects can affect the head, face, eyes, mouth, hands, feet, and internal organs. Some minor birth defects can be corrected and leave no trace, but others are more severe and stay with the baby for life. This page details numerous birth defects, from cleft palate and clubfoot to spina bifida and Down syndrome. If a mother and fetus don't have compatible blood, there can be severe complications for the fetus. Furthermore, any fetus the mother carries in the future is at risk, too, unless a doctor takes the proper steps to sensitize the mother. Find out what Rh is, how it affects your pregnancy, and what your doctor will do about it on this page. The baby isn't the only one who's at risk. Pregnancy can cause health issues for the mother too, from simple swelling of the hands and feet to increased risk of heart and kidney disease. And existing conditions in the mother, such as diabetes, can endanger a fetus. Most mothers are healthy throughout their pregnancy, but this page will tell you how to stay that way. Labor is a complicated process that can become difficult in several ways. If the baby and the umbilical cord are not positioned correctly, for example, the doctor may have to perform a cesarean section. Here you'll see what your doctor will be looking for and what he or she will do to correct anything that goes wrong. This information is solely for informational purposes.

By medical tradition, an older mother is defined as a woman pregnant at the age of 35 or older. In recent years there has been a trend for women to delay childbearing until their 30s and to have additional children in their 30s and 40s. Although most older women experience successful pregnancies and deliver healthy babies, they may encounter a variety of problems. The inability to become pregnant -- called infertility -- is more common in older women. Because women begin to ovulate less frequently after age 30, the number of opportunities to achieve fertilization decreases as each year goes by. For example, the average woman at age 30 ovulates 13 times a year; by age 40, she may ovulate only 5 or 6 times a year. Older women are also more likely to have problems with their reproductive organs, which may prevent pregnancy from occurring. Extensive endometriosis and uterine fibroids may make it impossible to become pregnant. As we become older, we are more likely to develop chronic illnesses, for example, high blood pressure, diabetes, and glandular disorders, such as an under-active thyroid gland (hypothyroidism). Though these illnesses may not be serious or life-threatening to the nonpregnant woman, they may become more serious or even uncontrollable during pregnancy. Furthermore, certain chronic illnesses of the mother are associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. Therefore, women with chronic illnesses need careful medical management during pregnancy. Older mothers are also at greater risk of having babies with severe birth defects caused by abnormalities of the baby's chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures contained within all cells of the body, including the egg and the sperm. These chromosomes contain the genetic information passed on from parent to baby. Normally, the sperm and the egg each contain 23 chromosomes. When the sperm and the egg join, the resulting cell, which develops to form the baby, contains the normal chromosome number of 46. In some cases, the egg may contain 24 chromosomes instead of the normal 23. If this egg combines with a normal sperm containing 23 chromosomes, the resulting fertilized egg contains 47 chromosomes -- an abnormal number. The baby that results from this fertilized egg then has 47 chromosomes in all the cells in its body. In many cases, a woman carrying a fetus with an abnormal chromosome number miscarries, accounting somewhat for the higher miscarriage rate in older women. Those pregnancies that continue normally result in a fetus with any one of a number of physical abnormalities. The most common condition associated with an abnormal chromosome number is Down syndrome, also called trisomy 21. Children with this condition are mentally retarded and may have serious abnormalities of the heart and digestive system. Children with Down syndrome have a characteristic facial appearance, with slanted eyes, heavy eyebrows, and a large, thick tongue. Though Down syndrome babies may be born to mothers of any age, they are more frequently born to older mothers. At the age of 20, a mother has 1 chance in 1,667 of having a child with Down syndrome; at the age of 35, she has 1 chance in 385; at the age of 40, she has 1 chance in 106. The prenatal care of an older woman is generally like that of a woman in any other age group. If the woman has a history of high blood pressure, diabetes, or other chronic disorders, prenatal office visits may be more frequent than usual, especially during the last two months of pregnancy. Mothers-to-be 35 years of age and older are offered prenatal testing to determine the presence of chromosome abnormalities in the fetus. Amniocentesis, the most commonly used test for detecting chromosome problems, is performed between the 16th and 18th weeks of pregnancy. Amniocentesis allows analysis of the fetal chromosomes to determine if there is an abnormal number. If an abnormality is discovered, the mother is given the option to terminate the pregnancy. Most older mothers experience normal labor and delivery. However, certain problems are more common in this age group, for example, placental abruption (premature separation of the placenta). Therefore, the rate of cesarean section is somewhat higher in older mothers. There are also health risks for babies of mothers who become pregnant while very young. On the next page you'll learn about the complications of teenage pregnancy. There are special risks to a baby when the mother is not fully mature. Because most teenagers are not phsycially, emotionally, or financially ready to carry and care for a child, their babies tend to have low birth weight and are predisposed to a variety of illnesses. A teenage mother will need the full support of her family to live a healthy lifestyle for her and her baby. Teen pregnancy has reached a 20-year low; however, teens give birth to approximately 500,000 babies each year. Teenagers often do not use contraceptives, and unfortunately, nearly two thirds of all teenage pregnancies are unintended. The vast majority of teen mothers are not married, but few give up children for adoption or care by others. For this reason, the mothers often must drop out of school and cannot hold full-time employment. They must suddenly assume the responsibility of raising a child before they are ready, emotionally or financially. Compared with mothers in older age groups, teenage mothers are at greater risk of having medical complications. Because the teenage mother is more likely to receive little or no prenatal care, she often becomes anemic and is more likely to develop preeclampsia, a severe condition associated with high blood pressure. Vitamin deficiencies are more common, and the teenage mother's weight gain is likely to be inadequate. Since the teenage mother is still growing herself, she needs to eat properly not only for her own growth but for normal growth of the fetus. Pelvic bones do not reach their maximum size until about the age of 18; therefore, the pelvis of the teenage mother may not have grown enough to allow vaginal delivery of a normal-size baby. For this reason, the incidence of cesarean section is higher in teenage mothers -- a baby that can be delivered vaginally when the mother is 20 is often too large to have been delivered vaginally when she was 14 years old. Babies born to teenage mothers are more likely to die in the first year of life compared with babies born to mothers older than 20 years of age. Since the teenage mother is less likely to eat correctly during pregnancy, her baby often has a low birth weight (less than 51/2 pounds), making it more likely the baby will become ill. The teenage mother should be encouraged to seek prenatal care early in pregnancy, eat a nutritious diet, take prescribed vitamins and iron supplements, and engage in healthy physical activity. Though a supportive family can help the teenage mother cope with her new responsibilities, social service agencies may be needed to help her find ways to finish school and seek employment. The average length of pregnancy is 40 weeks, or 280 days, from the first day of the last normal menstrual period. The due date, or expected date of delivery, for a pregnancy is calculated simply by adding nine months and seven days to the first day of a woman's last normal menstrual period. For example, if the first day of the last menstrual period was January 1, the expected date of delivery is nine months and seven days later -- on October 8. (Some physicians use the term expected date of confinement, or EDC, to describe the due date.) In reality, the majority of women do not actually give birth on the due date. About 80 percent of babies are born within ten days of the due date-either ten days before or ten days after. As long as the delivery occurs between 37 and 42 weeks, the pregnancy is considered full term. If the mother goes into labor before the due date, the baby could be in serious danger. In the next page, you will find out what to do if you go into premature labor. If you go into labor before your 37th week, you should go to the hospital immediately. Find out why premature birth is dangerous to the baby. Publications International, Ltd. Premature birth can be very dangerous to a newborn because it might not be developed enough to survive outside of the womb -- for example, if the lungs are not yet able to breathe. There are several reasons it happens, most of which the mother has no control over. If you suspect that you are going into labor prematurely, you should go to the hospital immediately because labor can be stopped up to a certain point. A preterm, or premature, delivery is defined as the birth of a baby between the 20th and 36th week of pregnancy. A baby born during this time is called premature. About 11 to 12 percent of deliveries in the United States are classified as premature; however, preterm deliveries are on the increase because more women are giving birth to multiple babies. A preterm delivery occurs because the mother goes into labor too early. Though in most cases there is no clear reason, abnormally early labor is often associated with the following conditions: An abnormally shaped uterus that may crowd the fetus Untreated diseases of the thyroid gland in the mother Other severe diseases in the mother, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and kidney disease Contrary to popular belief, severe emotional trauma and physical injury, such as from a fall, are uncommon causes of premature labor. If a mother has premature labor in one pregnancy, she has a 25 percent chance of premature labor in the next pregnancy. The major complication of preterm delivery is the birth of a baby who is unable to survive outside the mother's body. Though the baby's organs may all be correctly formed, his lungs may not be mature enough to allow him to breathe adequately after birth. Recent advances in the care of premature infants have allowed babies as small as 11/2 pounds to survive and grow up normally. Despite these advances, prematurity remains the leading cause of newborn death. If you suspect you are in labor before the 37th week of pregnancy, you should call your doctor and go to the hospital immediately. The doctor will check the cervix to determine if it has dilated. An electronic monitor may be used to detect contractions. Several different drugs may be used to stop the uterine contractions of premature labor. These drugs are initially given intravenously or subcutaneously (under the skin), and some may be given orally once contractions have stopped. Once it has been determined that contractions have stopped, you may remain in the hospital for two to three days to make certain that contractions do not start again. Once you go home, a doctor will generally advise you to restrict physical activity, refrain from sexual intercourse, and rest in bed as much as possible. Drugs used to stop preterm labor are more likely to be successful if the cervix has not dilated more than 4 centimeters (11/2 inches). If the cervix has dilated any more, most attempts to stop labor fail, and the baby will be delivered prematurely. This is one of the reasons why it is important to report to the hospital immediately if you suspect premature labor. On the other side of the spectrum, a postterm birth can also put the newborn baby at risk. Find out how on the next page. A postterm pregnancy occurs when the baby has not been delivered by the end of the 42nd week. There is no health risk to the mother, but after the 42nd week the fetus may be at risk of malnutrition. Also, if it passes fecal matter -- which usually does not happen until after birth -- and breathes it in, it may develop pnemonia. A doctor may choose to induce labor two weeks past the due date. The cause of postterm pregnancy is not known. In most cases, however, it is believed that the mother misstated the exact date of her last menstrual period and the pregnancy was not postterm after all. If a woman has had one postterm pregnancy, she has a greater than average chance of this happening again in subsequent pregnancies. Postterm pregnancy poses no health risk to the mother. However, as the placenta continues to age beyond the 42nd week of pregnancy, its ability to transmit oxygen and nutrients to the fetus may begin to decline. In some cases, this reduction in the transmission of oxygen and nutrients may be severe enough to cause the death of the fetus. If the fetus lives, at birth the baby commonly has a characteristic postterm appearance: wrinkled, cracking, peeling skin; long nails; abundant hair; and little fat tissue beneath the skin. The postterm baby often passes fecal material called meconium into the amniotic fluid before delivery. If the baby sucks meconium into his lungs at the time of delivery, severe pneumonia may result. The usual treatment for postterm pregnancy is to periodically check the fetal heartbeat until labor starts on its own or is induced (started artificially). Labor is induced by administering the drug oxytocin (Pitocin) intravenously. Oxytocin stimulates uterine contractions similar to those of normal labor. A fetal monitor is generally used to detect any abnormalities of the fetal heartbeat. Most women with an induced labor experience a normal labor and delivery. While postterm birth does not endanger the mother, ectopic pregnancy can be fatal. On the next page you'll learn what it is and how it affects the mother. An ultrasound may reveal the location of an ectopic pregnancy. Publications International, Ltd. Ectopic (out of place) pregnancy occurs when the fertilized egg develops outside the uterus. The most common location of ectopic pregnancy is in one of the fallopian tubes (structures that extend about 41/2 inches from the ovaries to the uterus and through which the egg travels from the ovary to the uterus). An ectopic pregnancy that occurs in a fallopian tube is called a tubal pregnancy. On rare occasions, the pregnancy starts to develop in the ovary, on the cervix, or attached to the surface of a nearby organ. An ectopic pregnancy is one in which the fertilized egg develops outside the uterus. One out of every 100 to 150 pregnancies is ectopic, most often in the fallopian tubes, but also in the ovary, on the cervix, or attached to another organ in the abdominal cavity. The usual cause of ectopic pregnancy is an obstruction or narrowing of a fallopian tube that prevents the fertilized egg from passing through the tube into the uterus. This obstruction or narrowing is sometimes the result of inflammation and scarring from a previous pelvic infection caused by a Gonococcus or Chlamydia infection. Tubal infections caused by numerous other bacteria can also occur after miscarriage, after childbirth, or during the use of an IUD (intrauterine contraceptive device). If these infections are severe, blockage or narrowing of the tube may result. Other less common causes of tubal obstruction or blockage include abdominal infections, such as appendicitis; pelvic tumors; and scar tissue formation after abdominal surgery. An ectopic pregnancy may be fatal unless it is promptly treated. Left undetected it can rupture the tube enclosing it, leading to profuse bleeding into the abdomen. Ectopic pregnancies located in other areas, such as the ovary and cervix, can invade nearby blood vessels and cause massive bleeding. In earlier years, ectopic pregnancy was catastrophic, often leading to death. Today, with the advent of safe blood transfusions and better diagnostic methods allowing early diagnosis, death resulting from ectopic pregnancy is uncommon. Symptoms of ectopic pregnancy usually appear two to four weeks after a woman has missed her menstrual period. Irregular spotting of blood from the vagina is one of the earliest symptoms. This is frequently followed by sharp, continuous pains on one side of the lower abdomen. If the ectopic pregnancy ruptures, the woman usually experiences sudden, sharp, severe pain in the lower abdomen accompanied by rapid heartbeat and backache and, in some cases, fainting. However, the woman may experience no unusual symptoms even up to the point of rupture. During a pelvic examination, the doctor may discover a tender swelling on one side of the pelvis. Movement of the uterus or ovaries during this examination may cause pain. If there is a high suspicion of ectopic pregnancy, the woman is immediately hospitalized. When an ectopic pregnancy is a possibility, an ultrasound of the pelvic structures may reveal the location of the ectopic pregnancy. Blood that has leaked from the ectopic pregnancy into the abdominal cavity may be detected by inserting a hollow needle through the wall of the vagina beneath the cervix and drawing off blood or by an examination using a pelvic ultrasound. The diagnosis is confirmed by inserting a laparoscope (a lighted, tube-like instrument) into the abdominal cavity through a small incision made below the navel. This allows the doctor to look directly at the pelvic organs and precisely locate the ectopic pregnancy. Treatment for ectopic pregnancy depends on several factors, including the size of the embryo and whether it has caused a rupture or not. If the embryo is small and the woman is not experiencing significant pain or bleeding, ectopic pregnancy may be treated using methotrexate, a drug that interferes with the growth of the embryo and causes it to be reabsorbed into the body. Methotrexate is administered as an injection, and the woman must be closely monitored for complications and success of the treatment. If the treatment fails, the embryo is large, or the woman is experiencing significant pain or bleeding, surgical removal is necessary. A woman who has had one ectopic pregnancy has a 15 percent chance of having a second one. This does not mean she should not try to become pregnant again, but when she does try, she should be especially watchful for symptoms of ectopic pregnancy. She should see her doctor as soon as she suspects she is pregnant so the location of the embryo may be determined. Even if the embryo develops normally, the pregnancy can still end in tragedy. On the next page you'll learn about the factors that lead to a stillbirth. Stillbirths, which come in the second or third trimester, are thankfully growing less common, but it is always sad news for the family when it happens. However, the conditions that can lead to a stillbirth, such as placenta complications and twisting of the umbilical cord, are often things that the mother has no control over. And the silver lining is that a stillbirth typically does not endanger the life of the mother. The death of the fetus at some time between the 20th week of pregnancy and birth is called stillbirth -- in medical terms, an intrauterine fetal demise. This tragic outcome of pregnancy is uncommon today because of better prenatal care and improved methods of diagnosing and treating abnormal pregnancies. The primary cause of stillbirth is interruption of the normal flow of oxygen and nutrients from the mother to the fetus via the placenta and the umbilical cord. Conditions that may adversely affect the placenta and cause stillbirth include toxemia, chronic high blood pressure, diabetes, placenta previa, and placental abruption. Less commonly, a problem with the umbilical cord, such as twisting or breakage of a blood vessel, may cut off the flow of blood to the fetus and lead to stillbirth. Certain abnormalities of the fetus -- including erythroblastosis; severe abnormalities of the heart, kidneys, and nervous system; and even fetal heart attack -- may lead to stillbirth. It is extremely rare for an injury to the mother to cause stillbirth. The death of the fetus within the uterus usually does not jeopardize the mother's health. The body generally has no reaction to fetal death except for loss of weight. Uncommonly, death of the fetus may cause abnormalities of the mother's blood clotting system, but only after the fetus has been dead for several weeks. Fetal death is usually brought to the doctor's attention by the woman's reporting that she has not felt the fetus move for a day or two. This absence of fetal movement is significant only in the last few months of pregnancy; before this, failure to note fetal movement for a day or two is normal. If the doctor fails to detect a heartbeat, confirmation of the diagnosis of stillbirth is sought with either an electronic heartbeat monitor or ultrasound. Spontaneous labor may begin any time from a few hours to up to 60 days after the death of the fetus. When labor does occur, it is usually normal. Today, most doctors choose to induce labor and deliver the fetus as soon as possible after the diagnosis of fetal death. This is accomplished either by administering the drug oxytocin intravenously or giving drugs called prostaglandins as vaginal suppositories. A pregnancy can also end tragically in miscarriage, and about 15 percent of births do. On the next page you'll learn what causes miscarriage and what the different types are. A miscarriage (in medical terms, a spontaneous abortion) is the expulsion from the uterus of the fetus and placenta before the beginning of the 20th week of pregnancy. At that point, the fetus is not developed enough to survive outside the uterus on its own. (After the 20th week of pregnancy and before the 36th week, expulsion of the fetus and placenta is considered premature delivery.) Most miscarriages occur within the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. It is impossible to know how many miscarriages occur during the first month of pregnancy, before many women may even realize they are pregnant. The only indication may be a slightly late menstrual period with a heavier than normal flow. However, about 15 percent of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. One of every five pregnant women experiences a threatened miscarriage when she bleeds vaginally during the first three months. Although it may indicate that a spontaneous abortion will eventually occur, it is often no more than a threat, and the pregnancy continues normally. An inevitable miscarriage occurs when the woman begins to bleed and the cervix dilates; it is then only a matter of time before the contents of the uterus are expelled. A missed miscarriage occurs when the fetus dies and the placenta stops growing; this may occur several days to weeks before the contents of the uterus are naturally expelled. An incomplete miscarriage occurs when only part of the uterine contents has been expelled. A complete miscarriage occurs when all of the uterine contents have been naturally expelled. The reason a miscarriage occurs is not always known, but in many cases it is believed that a fetus aborts because it is not developing normally. Several factors can contribute to abnormal fetal development, including the following: Disease in the mother, most notably rubella (German measles), severe heart or kidney disease, diabetes, or thyroid disease The mother's exposure to toxic substances or certain environmental pollutants Contrary to popular belief, severe emotional trauma or stress, automobile accidents, and simply falling rarely, if ever, cause miscarriage. The expulsion of the fetus because of an abnormality is thought to be a chance event, usually not due to a defect in either parent. Of women who miscarry once, most (80 percent) have a successful subsequent pregnancy. Although it is uncommon, some women miscarry three or more times in a row; they are called habitual aborters. When this occurs, the physician conducts a thorough evaluation of both the woman and her partner to determine the cause, if any. Frequently, a chromosome abnormality in one parent or an abnormality of the uterus is found. If an abnormality of the uterus is the cause of miscarriage, corrective surgery may be done, and a successful pregnancy often results. If the cause of miscarriage is a chromosome abnormality in either parent, the problem cannot be corrected. Miscarriage is rarely life-threatening for the mother, especially if diagnosed and treated promptly. Though blood loss may occur, it is generally not enough to cause serious problems. The symptoms of miscarriage are vaginal bleeding (from a few drops to a heavy flow) and uterine cramps (either dull and constant or sharp and intermittent) felt in the lower part of the abdomen or back. The bleeding can start suddenly or follow a brownish discharge. A solid clot of blood or tissue may pass from the vagina. If possible, this should be saved for the doctor, who may be able to examine it and determine the cause of the bleeding. A pregnant woman who starts bleeding or experiences abdominal pain should contact her doctor immediately. If a threatened miscarriage is diagnosed, the doctor generally directs the woman to rest in bed, avoid heavy lifting and pushing, and abstain from sexual intercourse. Though it is traditional for doctors to give this advice, many physicians feel little can be done to stop or avert a miscarriage. After an inevitable, incomplete, or missed miscarriage, any tissue remaining in the uterus causes continued bleeding and possibly infection. To remove any retained tissue, the doctor performs a D & C (dilatation and curettage). This is a surgical procedure in which the cervix is dilated by means of tapered metal dilators, and the contents of the uterus are scraped out with suction and a sharp instrument called a curette. If you are carrying more than one fetus, you also might not carry to full term. On the next page find out why multiple births increase the liklihood of premature labor. Multiple births can be a joyous occasion, but they are not without peril. Publications International, Ltd. Twins and triplets are often seen as an additional blessing on a growing family. But multiple births also can cause complications, the most serious of which is premature birth. Because the babies may not be ready to live outside the mother's womb, treatment of multiple births mostly involves preventing premature labor, and lots of bed rest is a common method. The number of multiple births is increasing as women wait until they are older to have a baby and use fertility drugs to conceive. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, between 1980 and 2000, the number of twin births increased 74 percent, and the number of triplets, quadruplets, and other higher order births increased fivefold. Multiple births occur more commonly in older women; women who have had at least one previous pregnancy; women who have a family history of multiple pregnancy on the mother's side of the family; and women who have taken fertility drugs to stimulate ovulation (the expulsion of an egg from the ovary). There are two types of twins. One type starts from a single egg, which divides in two very early after fertilization. Because a single egg is fertilized by a single sperm before this division, the two offspring will be of the same sex and alike in skin, hair, and eye color and in general appearance. They are identical twins. An extremely rare form of identical twinning is called conjoined, or Siamese, twinning. In these unfortunate cases, the twins are attached to each other at the head, chest, abdomen, or back. Surgical separation may be successful but often results in the death of one or both babies. The other type of twinning is the result of fertilization of two eggs by two different sperm. Twins of this type -- called fraternal twins -- may be of the same sex or of opposite sexes and bear no greater resemblance to each other than any other brothers and sisters. Most twins that result from the use of fertility drugs are of this type. Approximately one third of twins are identical, and two thirds are fraternal. One or more eggs may be involved in other forms of multiple pregnancy. For example, quadruplets may result from one, two, three, or four eggs. In most cases of multiple birth, the cause is unknown. Why certain families have many sets of twins is also not understood. Fertility drugs used to stimulate ovulation are often associated with multiple births -- sometimes up to eight fetuses. Doctor and patient alike often suspect multiple pregnancy when the woman's uterus grows more rapidly than one would expect with one baby. Confirmation comes when the doctor hears two separate fetal heartbeats or an ultrasound shows two or more fetuses. The major complication of multiple pregnancy is premature labor, with the delivery of small, premature babies who are not yet ready to live outside the mother's body. In general, the more fetuses a woman is carrying, the earlier in pregnancy she is likely to go into labor. Other complications that may affect the mother are anemia and preeclampsia. Women with multiple pregnancies are very carefully monitored. The doctor's special care of a woman with a multiple pregnancy aims at preventing premature labor and detecting and treating anemia and preeclampsia. When multiple pregnancy is diagnosed, the woman is advised to avoid strenuous activity and rest in bed as much as possible. She may even be admitted to the hospital weeks before the expected delivery date. Prenatal visits are more frequent than usual (at least once a week) so the doctor can detect the early stages of premature labor and preeclampsia. The position of the twins in the uterus is quite variable: both babies may be head first, the first baby may be head first and the second may be breech (buttocks or legs first), the first may be breech and the second may be head first, or both may be breech. If both are head first, doctors usually allow a vaginal delivery. When the babies are in other positions, however, a cesarean section is usually performed to ensure a safe delivery of both babies. Because of the serious problems that may be encountered in the vaginal delivery of other types of multiple pregnancies, most pregnancies involving three or more babies are delivered by means of cesarean section. A cesarean section may be necessary for multiple births, and is almost always necessary when there are complications with the placenta. Read on to learn about these conditions. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can be a sign of a problem with the placenta. Find out what to do about placenta previa and placental abruption. Publications International, Ltd. From the time of the last normal menstrual period to the time of labor, a pregnant woman should not experience any bleeding from the vagina. During the first half of pregnancy, the most serious causes of bleeding are miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy; during the last half of pregnancy, the most serious causes are placenta previa and placental abruption. In placenta previa, the placenta is located low in the uterine cavity, partially or completely covering the opening of the cervix. As the lower portion of the uterus stretches and dilates during the latter weeks of pregnancy, portions of the placenta may be torn from their attachment to the wall of the uterus. This leads to variable amounts of bleeding, ranging from light to profuse. The exact cause of placenta previa is unknown. It is the leading cause of vaginal bleeding during the second and third trimesters. The major symptom of placenta previa is painless vaginal bleeding. This bleeding may begin as early as the 24th to 26th week of pregnancy, though it is more common during the last 4 or 5 weeks. The blood is usually bright red, indicating the bleeding is fresh. This bleeding occurs without any previous injury (for example, from a fall). In some cases, the blood flow is light (referred to as spotting). Abdominal pain or cramping generally does not accompany the bleeding unless the woman is in labor. Any vaginal bleeding during pregnancy is abnormal and should be reported to the doctor immediately. The doctor orders an ultrasound image of the mother's abdomen to locate the placenta. In most cases of placenta previa, the ultrasound shows the placenta covering part or all of the opening of the cervix. Bleeding from a placenta previa may be extremely heavy, leading to severe blood loss from the mother. This bleeding stops only after the baby has been delivered and the placenta has been removed. Unless treatment is rapid in the case of heavy bleeding, death of both the mother and the baby may result. Since the placenta covers part or all of the opening of the cervix, a normal vaginal delivery cannot be attempted since extreme hemorrhage will occur. For this reason, babies of most mothers with placenta previa are delivered by means of cesarean section. Once placenta previa has been diagnosed, the doctor recommends the best treatment -- either delayed or active. Delayed treatment involves admitting the woman to the hospital, keeping her on bed rest, and closely monitoring her for any recurrence of bleeding. The purpose of delayed treatment is to give the fetus time to mature so that it can survive outside the mother's body. Once the maturity of the fetus has been established, delivery is by means of cesarean section. In the case of active treatment, the baby is delivered by means of cesarean section as soon as possible. The degree of vaginal bleeding usually dictates the type of treatment. If vaginal bleeding is slight and the fetus is not yet mature, the doctor generally recommends delayed treatment. If vaginal bleeding is heavy, a cesarean section is performed immediately to save the life of the mother and the baby, even if the baby is premature. After delivery of a baby, the uterus begins to contract, separating the placenta from its wall and pushing it into the vagina. In the case of placental abruption, the placenta begins to separate from the uterine wall before the delivery of the baby. This occurs to some degree in about 1 of every 150 pregnancies. The exact cause of placental abruption is unknown. However, a number of conditions are commonly associated with placental abruption, including high blood pressure in the mother, severe trauma to the mother's abdomen, cigarette smoking or drug use, and advanced age of the mother. The major symptoms of placental abruption are vaginal bleeding and strong, continuous pain over the uterus and sometimes across the back. Bleeding may be as slight as a tablespoon or extremely heavy. In some cases, no bleeding is visible, and the only symptom is pain. If blood loss is great, the woman experiences rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, fainting, and even shock. The diagnosis of placental abruption is made on the basis of the woman's history and the doctor's findings of blood in the vagina and a tender, painful uterus. No specific tests can diagnose placental abruption. In most cases, even the findings on ultrasound are normal. Bleeding associated with a placental abruption may be extremely heavy and, without rapid treatment, may lead to death of both the mother and the fetus. Even if the mother does not bleed heavily, the placenta may separate from the wall of the uterus to an extent that the fetus does not receive a sufficient oxygen supply to survive. In some cases, the mother's blood may fail to clot normally, leading to even more profuse vaginal bleeding. The treatment of placental abruption may be either delayed or active. If vaginal bleeding is slight or has stopped and the fetus remains unharmed, the mother is admitted to the hospital for observation until all signs of placental abruption have stopped. If, on the other hand, vaginal bleeding is heavy or the fetus shows signs of lack of oxygen, delivery must occur quickly. A mother who is already in labor is monitored closely and may expect to give birth vaginally if she and the fetus remain stable. In the case of heavy bleeding, a cesarean section is performed immediately. Before or after delivery, the mother may require a blood transfusion if she experiences severe blood loss. Each of these conditions can lead to a cesarean section. Continue reading to find out more about this extremely safe procedure. Cesarean section is necessary when a normal birth would endanger either the mother or the baby. This can be due to the size and position of the baby, the presence of bacteria, or because of multiple births. There are two types of cesaren section, but modern medicine has made both of them extremely safe procedures. Cesarean section is the delivery of a baby by cutting through the abdominal wall and uterus and removing the baby through these incisions. Almost 30 percent of all births in the United States are by cesarean section. Cesarean section is performed when delivery of the baby is necessary and when a vaginal delivery would cause injury to either the mother or the baby. Some of the specific reasons for a cesarean section include the following: To save the baby's life when problems with the placenta or the umbilical cord cut off the blood supply to the baby (This event is often detected when abnormal heart rate patterns appear on a fetal monitor.) To deliver the baby if the mother is unable to give birth after a long labor, in most cases because the baby is too large to pass through the pelvis To prevent infection of the baby from dangerous bacteria in the surrounding amniotic fluid or a dangerous vaginal or cervical infection To prevent injury to the baby during a breech birth, when the baby would emerge buttocks or feet first through the vagina rather than head first (Many obstetricians believe that all breech births in first-time mothers and all premature breech births require cesarean delivery.) To treat disease of the mother or the baby that can be treated better if birth occurs as soon as possible To prevent the chance of rupture of the uterus during labor if the mother has had a previous cesarean section, especially of the classical type To deliver multiple pregnancies involving three or more fetuses In the classical cesarean section, a vertical cut is made directly down the center of the uterus in its thick upper section. The incision on the skin may be horizontal or vertical. This operation is generally performed only if the baby is lying in an abnormal position or if the placenta is in an abnormally low position in the cavity of the uterus. With this type of cesarean section, more bleeding occurs than with other methods, the incision is more difficult to repair, and the uterus is more likely to rupture during a future pregnancy. For these reasons, the classical cesarean section is seldom used today unless there are specific reasons for its use. The lower-segment cesarean section is the more commonly performed operation. Here, a horizontal incision is made in the lower, thinner portion of the uterus. The incision made on the skin may be smile-shaped (the ""bikini"" incision) near the lower part of the abdomen. To minimize risks associated with a cesarean section, the operation should be performed only by a skilled obstetrician, accompanied by an anesthesiologist to administer anesthesia to the mother. In some cases, a pediatrician may also participate to take care of the baby after birth. Risks associated with cesarean section include possible infection, excessive bleeding, and dangerous blood clots that may enter the blood circulation. Further, the operation may be inconvenient for the mother, requiring her to stay in the hospital at least two or three days instead of going home with the baby soon after a vaginal delivery. And although the use of general anesthesia is now uncommon with cesarean section, if it was used, a woman may not be able to see the baby for a number of hours after delivery. (Breast-feeding following cesarean section should not present a problem if adequate pain relief is provided and maintained for the mother.) She will have pain from the operative incision, and once she arrives home, she will need to restrict her activity for a while. It takes up to six weeks for complete healing of the incision. Of course, all these inconveniences are small if the result is a healthy mother and a healthy baby. And today, fortunately, cesarean section is an extremely safe operation because of improved antibiotics and better anesthesia. In the past, women undergoing cesarean section have been separated from their husbands during surgery, and as a result have often expressed negative feelings of isolation and inadequacy for having failed to accomplish a vaginal delivery. To assist these parents and prevent this from happening to others, many childbirth instructors provide couples with more information about cesarean section. In many hospitals, husbands are allowed to remain with their wives during the operation. Generally, allowing fathers in the operating room has not caused problems, and women who have undergone cesarean section with their husbands at their sides have shared and enjoyed the birth experience in a far more positive way. In the past, a firm rule in obstetrics was ""once a section, always a section."" More recently, obstetricians have found that many women with a previous cesarean section can have a safe vaginal delivery in a subsequent pregnancy. To minimize the risks of rupture of the uterine scar during labor, certain criteria must be met: The previous cesarean must have been only the lower-segment type; the mother's pelvis must be of normal size; and the indication for the previous cesarean should not exist with the present pregnancy. While cesarean sections do not typically affect a baby long-term, birth defects can be lifelong conditions. On the next page you'll learn what some of the more common birth defects are. All expectant parents dream of having normal, healthy children. Unfortunately, sometimes this does not happen. Although most babies are born normal and whole, about 3 percent are born with some form of abnormality. Fortunately, about half of these imperfect babies have only minor defects that can be easily corrected, leaving no trace. In the other half, however, the defect may be severe and even life-threatening. Birth defects, also called congenital anomalies, can affect nearly every organ of the baby's body. In some cases, these defects are visible on the surface of the body; in other cases, the defects involve internal organs, such as the heart or intestines. Another type of defect, called an inborn error of metabolism, is not visible but rather is an abnormality of the chemical system of the body in which normal chemical reactions in certain organs cannot occur. The following is a list of the most common serious birth defects: Head and face: Hydrocephalus (an abnormally large head due to accumulation of fluid), microcephaly (an abnormally small head), cleft lip and cleft palate (an abnormal opening in the lip and the roof of the mouth) Heart: Congenital heart disease (a variety of different defects in the valves and walls of the heart) Lungs: Absence of one lung, abnormal lung development Abdominal wall: An opening through the navel or a large defect that causes the intestines to protrude Kidneys: Absence of one or both kidneys, large cysts in the kidneys, developmental abnormalities of the kidneys (such as variations in structure) Back: Spina bifida (an abnormal opening in the backbone in which nerves are contained in a thin, saclike structure) Arms and legs: Absence of fingers or toes, fused fingers or toes, total absence of an arm or leg, clubfoot (an abnormal inward turning of the foot) Little is known about the cause of most congenital anomalies. Heredity plays a role in some cases; some families have several members with similar abnormalities. Certain drugs, environmental pollutants, toxins, and high doses of radiation cause specific abnormalities. Certain infections in the mother -- the most significant of these is German measles (rubella) -- may cause multiple severe abnormalities. The mother's heavy drinking during pregnancy can cause fetal alcohol syndrome. In most cases, however, the exact reason for the abnormality is not known and probably derives from a disturbance in the normal organ development of the fetus. The ability to detect congenital abnormalities before birth is a relatively recent medical achievement. In addition to allowing some couples to terminate an abnormal pregnancy, it has enabled others who may be at risk of having abnormal offspring to continue a pregnancy knowing the fetus is normal. During the first prenatal visit, the doctor obtains a thorough history of both parents, including age, race, ethnic background, and previous abnormal conditions in the family. This information is used to determine if testing for an abnormal fetus is necessary. The following tests detect specific abnormalities: Ultrasonography: detects hydrocephalus, microcephaly, spina bifida, tumors, heart defects, intestinal blockage, and absence of an arm or leg. Blood tests: The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test (the most commonly used blood test to detect fetal abnormality) helps detect spina bifida. Amniocentesis: detects chromosome abnormalities, spina bifida, and nearly 100 chemical disorders in the fetus. Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): detects the same chromosomal abnormalities as amniocentesis, but the test can be performed earlier in the pregnancy. Once an abnormality of the fetus has been detected, the parents must make a decision to either terminate or continue the pregnancy. However, the many remarkable advances in medical and surgical care can wholly cure many birth abnormalities considered very serious a few decades ago. Many heart defects, intestinal obstructions, and abnormalities of the abdominal wall can be corrected surgically, and those children born with them can expect to lead normal and healthy lives. A pediatrician and a surgeon should describe to the parents the extent of the fetal abnormality and the chances of correcting it. Research currently underway may eventually enable surgical correction of certain types of congenital abnormalities while the fetus is still in the uterus. Fortunately, in most cases, birth defects do not repeat themselves in future pregnancies. Parents with one abnormal child have an average risk of less than 5 percent of having another child with the same abnormality. If, however, the defect is thought to be inherited from one parent, a specific pattern of this abnormality may be repeating itself. Before the parents of an abnormal child plan another pregnancy, they should meet with a doctor skilled in genetics and fetal abnormalities to discuss the risks of abnormalities appearing again. The birth of a physically abnormal child can produce feelings of shock, disbelief, sadness, and even anger in the parents. All members of the family are in some way affected by the birth. The parents must create a mutual support system to cope with this crisis. Gradually, the parents resolve their grief and become as closely attached to this child as they would to any other. Genes, disease, and alcohol use can all contribute to abnormal development of a fetus. Continue reading to find out how a fetus also can be affected if its blood is incompatible with the mother's. Because not everyone has the substance know as the Rh factor, it becomes an issue during pregnancy. While it may seem counterintuitive, the problem arises when the mother is Rh-negative and her fetus is Rh-positive, and the problem can affect a future fetus as well. A simple injection can guard against life-threatening conditions in a fetus. Approximately 90 percent of people are born with a substance on their blood cells known as the Rh factor, so called because a similar substance is found on the blood cells of rhesus monkeys. Individuals who have this factor on their blood cells are called Rh-positive; those without it are called Rh-negative. The presence of the Rh factor is inherited from one's parents. Problems can occur in the fetus if the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive. Normally, some fetal blood escapes from the placenta and enters the mother's blood. If both the mother and fetus are Rh-positive, this leakage of fetal blood causes no problems. However, since this fetal blood containing the Rh factor is a foreign substance to a mother who is Rh-negative, the mother's body forms antibodies against the Rh factor. The body normally forms antibodies in response to foreign substances -- usually bacteria and viruses that may be harmful. These antibodies act by destroying the foreign substance, thus protecting the body against their harmful effects. A person who forms antibodies against a substance is called sensitized to that particular substance. If the mother forms these antibodies against Rh-positive blood, the antibodies cross from the mother into the fetus and start destroying fetal blood cells. This leads to a serious condition in the fetus called erythroblastosis, which may lead to anemia, heart failure, and even stillbirth. When an Rh-negative mother becomes sensitized, it is usually at the time of the birth of her first Rh-positive baby. This baby is generally unaffected. But the mother keeps her antibodies against Rh-positive blood for life. If she has another pregnancy with an Rh-positive fetus, this fetus may be affected. During early pregnancy, the doctor performs a blood test to determine if the mother has Rh-positive or Rh-negative blood. If the mother is Rh-negative, the father is also tested to determine his Rh factor. If he is Rh-positive, the baby may be Rh-positive as well. As a precaution, to prevent the mother from becoming sensitized to Rh-positive blood, her doctor may recommend she receive an injection of a substance called human anti-Rh immune globulin at 28 weeks of pregnancy. If her baby is found at birth to be Rh-positive, the mother will receive another injection within two days of delivery. The human anti-Rh immune globulin prevents the mother's body from developing Rh antibodies that would cause complications. An injection may also be given if the mother has an amniocentesis, a miscarriage, or an ectopic pregnancy. If it is found that the mother has already developed Rh antibodies, the pregnancy is closely monitored to determine if blood transfusions are necessary. The Rh factor is an issue only during pregnancy. On the next page you'll learn about diseases that are either exclusive to pregnancy or more pronounced during this time. Several diseases are more pronounced during pregnancy, and several more affect only pregnant women. Diabetes is no longer a life-threatening complication, but can lead to abnormally small babies. Publications International, Ltd. The majority of women enter pregnancy healthy and remain so until delivery of the baby. Aside from a variety of minor problems -- for example, backache, morning sickness, and constipation -- the woman generally tolerates the many changes in her body that result from pregnancy. In some cases, however, either the mother enters pregnancy with a medical problem or a problem develops during pregnancy. Some of these conditions affect only the mother, while others may affect both mother and baby. Toxemia of pregnancy is a severe condition that sometimes occurs in the latter weeks of pregnancy. It is characterized by high blood pressure; swelling of the hands, feet, and face; and an excessive amount of protein in the urine. If the condition is allowed to worsen, the mother may experience convulsions and coma, and the baby may be stillborn. The term toxemia is actually a misnomer from the days when it was thought that the condition was caused by toxic (poisonous) substances in the blood. The illness is more accurately called preeclampsia before the convulsive stage and eclampsia afterward. The causes of preeclampsia and eclampsia are not clearly understood. They tend to develop more often in women who are having their first baby, especially teenage mothers and women from lower socioeconomic groups. One theory proposes that certain dietary deficiencies may be the cause of some cases. Also, there is the possibility that some forms of preeclampsia and eclampsia are the result of deficiency of blood flow in the uterus. The symptoms of toxemia of pregnancy (which may lead to death if not treated) are divided into three stages, each progressively more serious: Mild preeclampsia symptoms include edema (puffiness under the skin due to fluid accumulation in the body tissues, often noted around the ankles), mild elevation of blood pressure, and the presence of small amounts of protein in the urine. Severe preeclampsia symptoms include extreme edema, extreme elevation of blood pressure, the presence of large amounts of protein in the urine, headache, dizziness, double vision, nausea, vomiting, and severe pain in the right upper portion of the abdomen. Preeclampsia and eclampsia cannot be completely cured until the pregnancy is over. Until that time, treatment includes the control of high blood pressure and the intravenous administration of drugs to prevent convulsions. Drugs may also be given to stimulate the production of urine. In some severe cases, early delivery of the baby is needed to ensure the survival of the mother. There is no known preventive for toxemia of pregnancy. Though the restriction of salt in the diet may help reduce swelling, it does not prevent the onset of high blood pressure or the appearance of protein in the urine. During prenatal visits, the doctor routinely checks the woman's weight, blood pressure, and urine. If toxemia is detected early, complications may be reduced. Learn about other medical conditions during pregnancy next. Although the incidence of heart disease among women in their childbearing years has declined dramatically in recent years, it still remains one of the major causes of death in pregnant women. Most women with known heart disease withstand pregnancy without any problems. However, in some cases in which the heart muscle or valves are seriously diseased, the added strain normally placed on the heart during pregnancy may lead to heart failure and even death. For this reason, any woman who knows that she has a heart problem should check with her doctor before attempting to become pregnant. The most common disease of the kidneys during pregnancy is pyelonephritis, a bacterial infection of the kidney. This can occur when an infection of the bladder allows bacteria to travel up to the kidneys. Symptoms include fever, severe low back pain, and chills. It is important to treat pyelonephritis quickly because it may cause a pregnant woman to go into premature labor. All instances of severe low back pain and fever should be reported to the doctor immediately. Women who have severe kidney disease before pregnancy can have many serious problems during pregnancy. Extremely high blood pressure and kidney failure (inability to produce urine) are life-threatening complications for both the mother and the fetus. Some women with severe kidney disease may be advised not to become pregnant. Consult your doctor if you have any questions. Before the discovery of insulin for the treatment of diabetes, women with diabetes who became pregnant either miscarried or the pregnancy resulted in the death of the mother and baby. Today, a diabetic woman can expect to deliver a healthy, normal baby. Even though medical care of the diabetic woman has improved greatly in the last decade, a variety of serious problems may be associated with pregnancy, including an increased chance of preeclampsia, stillbirth, and abnormally small babies. For these reasons, it is important for a diabetic woman to achieve excellent glucose control prior to conception to decrease her risks for complications associated with pregnancy. Once pregnant, the diabetic woman should expect more frequent prenatal office visits and more laboratory testing. It is important for her to maintain a strict diet, exercise appropriately, and take her insulin at all the prescribed times. Another form of diabetes -- called gestational, or pregnancy-induced, diabetes -- affects women only during pregnancy. In this disorder, women who were not diabetic before pregnancy display signs of diabetes only when they are pregnant. During routine prenatal office visits, the pregnant woman's urine is always tested for the presence of sugar, or glucose (urine should normally contain no glucose). If sugar appears in the urine, the doctor performs a blood test to see if the woman's blood sugar level is abnormally high. In addition, most physicians now routinely perform a blood test called a glucose challenge test at 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy, even if urine tests have been normal. If the results show elevated levels, a more complex test is done to confirm the diagnosis. Women with pregnancy-induced diabetes are generally treated with a special diet that restricts their intake of sugar and carbohydrates. Insulin is sometimes necessary to bring the blood sugar level down to normal. Since women with pregnancy-induced diabetes also are at a greater risk for preeclampsia and stillbirth, they can expect to have more frequent prenatal visits. These women are also at risk of having macrosomic, or very large, babies. About 30 to 40 percent of women who develop gestational diabetes go on to develop nongestational diabetes several years after pregnancy. Postpartum weight control can help reduce this risk. The most common digestive system problem affecting pregnant women is hyperemesis gravidarum. In this condition, the woman suffers excessive or abnormal vomiting. This vomiting is more severe than that caused by normal ""morning sickness,"" which usually clears up on its own within a few months. In hyperemesis gravidarum, the vomiting leads to starvation, loss of water in the body, and an imbalance in bodily fluids. Symptoms include weight loss and dehydration. The condition is most often treated in the hospital through the use of antivomiting drugs and intravenous feeding. A pregnant woman should not attempt to treat herself with drugs for vomiting without first consulting her doctor. Lung disease is uncommon in pregnant women with the exception of occasional bouts of cough and congestion associated with the flu or a cold. The most serious lung disease to affect a pregnant woman is asthma. In women who have only mild asthma attacks before pregnancy, their asthma may stay the same, improve, or worsen. In women with severe asthma before pregnancy, symptoms usually worsen during pregnancy. Women with severe asthma are also more likely to have premature labor and small babies. Before a woman with severe asthma attempts to become pregnant, she should consult her doctor. Fatty liver disease and HELLP syndrome, both of which affect the liver, are rare. Fatty liver disease is generally associated with preeclampsia and occurs in the third trimester of pregnancy. The cause is unknown, but symptoms include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Liver failure may result. HELLP syndrome (which is named after its characteristics: Hemolysis, a breakdown of red blood cells; Elevated Liver enzymes; and a Low Platelet count) is a severe form of preeclampsia and is, in part, characterized by liver inflammation. If a woman knows she has liver disease, she should check with her doctor before attempting to become pregnant. The most common nervous system problem in a pregnant woman is headache, generally caused by tension, migraine, or an infection of the sinuses or throat. Simple measures, such as lying down in a quiet room and applying ice packs over the forehead, relieve most simple headaches. However, since a headache may be a symptom of high blood pressure associated with preeclampsia, all severe or persistent headaches should be reported to the doctor immediately. Numbness and tingling of the fingers, thighs, and toes are quite common in pregnancy and usually result from retention of water and swelling. Epilepsy is the most serious nervous system problem that can affect a pregnant woman. About half of women with epilepsy experience worsening of symptoms during pregnancy. Furthermore, certain drugs commonly used to treat epilepsy may cause birth defects in the baby. Before a woman with epilepsy attempts to become pregnant, she should check with her doctor. Several types of skin changes are common in pregnant women and result from the normal hormonal changes of pregnancy. Darkening of the skin is common, especially on the face, abdomen, vulva, thighs, and around the nipples. As pregnancy progresses, the palms of the hands often become red, and small spider veins may develop on the arms and face. Stretch marks on the skin of the lower part of the abdomen usually develop late in pregnancy. Several types of skin diseases occur only in pregnancy. These appear as numerous small, raised bumps that are usually extremely itchy. Though these conditions are rarely serious, report any unusual skin changes or itching to your doctor. Learn about infectious diseases during pregnancy on the next page. Newborns can suffer greatly from infectious diseases in the mother. Publications International, Ltd. Though most common infectious diseases, such as colds and the flu, have no effect on pregnancy, some diseases transmitted by other people may have very serious effects on the baby. The herpes virus is responsible for frequent, painful ulcers that may occur in the genital areas of both men and women. A sexually transmitted disease, this virus is spread by direct genital contact. Though this infection rarely causes serious problems in the woman, the newborn baby may become seriously infected and die if she comes into contact with an open herpes ulcer during delivery. For this reason, cesarean section is performed if a woman has a herpes ulcer in the genital region when she is in labor. If a woman knows she has had herpes, it is important that she tell her doctor, so he or she carefully examines the genital area during prenatal visits. Syphilis is another sexually transmitted disease that may seriously affect the baby. If a mother has an active syphilis infection during pregnancy, the bacteria may enter the baby's bloodstream and cause a variety of abnormalities, including malformations of the heart, eyes, bones, and mouth. As a part of the routine blood testing of the mother during the first prenatal visit, a blood test to detect the presence of syphilis is usually performed. If a pregnant woman thinks she may have acquired syphilis during pregnancy, she should tell her doctor immediately. Rubella (German measles) is a common infectious disease that usually affects children. The rash and fever of rubella usually pass within a few days, and complete recovery from the infection is the rule. Rubella infection during pregnancy, however, may have many serious effects on the baby, especially if the infection develops early in pregnancy when the organs of the fetus are just beginning to form. Complications in the baby may include microcephaly (abnormally small head), mental retardation, seizures, defects in the eyes, heart malformations, and deafness. If a pregnant woman suspects she may have come into contact with someone with rubella, she should report it to her doctor immediately, even if a rash or fever has not yet appeared. The doctor may then perform blood tests to determine if the woman has actually contracted rubella. Since rubella infection in pregnancy is serious, a woman who is considering becoming pregnant should undergo testing to see if she is immune to rubella. Usually, if a person has had rubella at one time in her life, she never gets the infection again. If a woman is not immune, most doctors advise that she obtain a rubella vaccination before becoming pregnant. Toxoplasmosis is another infection that may have serious effects on the baby. The mother may become infected with the Toxoplasma organism if she eats infected raw meat or if she is in close contact with cats infected with Toxoplasma. Babies born to infected mothers may have many serious birth defects, including microcephaly, seizures, and other disorders of the brain, and conditions involving the liver, blood, lungs, and kidneys. To avoid toxoplasmosis, a pregnant woman should always cook meat thoroughly and avoid contact with cat litter boxes. These are all ailments that can occur during pregnancy. On the next page you will learn what conditions to watch out for during labor. As complicated as labor is, there are a number of situations that can arise that would present a danger to the mother, the baby, or both. The baby and the umbilical cord must be correcting positioned in the birth canal throughout the process for a healthy delivery. While a condition as mild as slow labor can be easily corrected with medicine, several other complications are more severe. The remedy for many of these complications is birth by cesarean section. Labor is defined as the process by which the uterus rhythmically contracts and expels the baby and placenta. Labor is a progressive process that generally does not stop until the baby and placenta have been delivered. For a woman pregnant with her first child, the average length of time from the beginning of labor to the delivery of the baby is about 14 hours; for a woman with at least one previous delivery, it is about 8 hours. During a woman's labor, the doctor examines the cervix periodically (about every two hours) to determine how far it has dilated (widened). Before labor begins, the cervix is closed. When the cervix is fully dilated, it has reached 10 centimeters in diameter (there are 2.54 centimeters per inch). At this point, the baby's head has enough room to move into the vagina and be delivered. The nurse or doctor also checks the baby's heartbeat during labor. Sometimes a special stethoscope called a fetoscope may be used. More commonly today, hospitals use an electronic fetal monitor. With this device, a special microphone is placed on the mother's abdomen above the uterus and secured with a strap. This microphone is connected to the fetal monitor, which amplifies the sound of the heartbeat and records the heart rate on a moving strip of paper. The baby's heart rate during labor is normally in the range of 110 to 160 beats per minute. Another function of the fetal monitor is to record the mother's labor contractions. A special pressure-sensing device is secured to the abdomen with a strap and then connected to the monitor. Each time a labor contraction occurs, it shows up on the monitor paper as a short wave. By watching the monitor, the nurses and the doctor can tell how frequently the mother is having contractions. Some women may experience abnormally slow labor, which is usually caused by mild or infrequent contractions. The doctor can detect this by looking at the fetal monitor and noting that the cervix is dilating slowly. The usual treatment of slow labor is to give the drug oxytocin (Pitocin) intravenously. Oxytocin speeds up labor contractions and causes them to become stronger. In some cases, the mother may have been in labor for many hours without giving birth. The doctor's examination usually shows that either the cervix has stopped dilating or the baby is still high up in the mother's pelvis. In medical terms, this problem is called failure to progress. Failure to progress is usually caused by one of two problems: either the baby is too large to fit through the mother's pelvic bones or the mother's pelvic bones are too small to allow the delivery of even a normal-size baby. Since in many cases of failure to progress the baby cannot fit through the pelvis, cesarean section is necessary to ensure a safe delivery. The umbilical cord is the attachment between the fetus and the placenta. It literally forms the lifeline of the fetus through which it obtains oxygen and nutrients from the mother. During labor, a portion of the umbilical cord may prolapse (fall down) into the vagina before the baby is delivered. If this occurs, the umbilical cord may become compressed between the fetal head and the walls of the mother's pelvis, thereby cutting off the blood supply to the fetus. Unless a vaginal delivery is expected to occur immediately, cesarean section must be performed to save the baby's life. During labor, the fetal heart rate is normally steady. In some situations, however, there may be a decrease, or deceleration, of the heart rate during uterine contractions. Compression of the fetal head against the wall of the mother's pelvis may give a particular pattern of deceleration that is quite normal, especially during the latter parts of labor. Serious causes of fetal heart rate deceleration include problems with the placenta and a compressed or pinched-off umbilical cord. Since these decelerations may mean that the fetus is not getting enough oxygen, immediate delivery of the baby -- usually by means of cesarean section -- is necessary. The range of complications that can have severe repurcussions on a mother and baby may seem like they make pregnancy a scary time. But most pregnancies are normal and healthy, and hospitals are well equipped to handle most adverse situations. Knowing what to do in the unlikely event something does go wrong will help you delivery a strong, healthy baby. Excessive bleeding or hemorrhage is a serious complication of labor and is usually caused by either placenta previa or placental abruption. Immediate cesarean section is usually necessary to save the life of both the mother and baby. It is not healthy or helpful to dwell on what can go wrong during a pregnancy. However, a little knowledge about pregnancy complications can show you that they are rare, often corrected, and an aspect of pregnancy that all parent have to confront. is a practicing obstetrician with her own private practice in New York City.

4114467b-7aa1-4f5d-8f37-e985295c3611,"Getting regular checkups is the best way to monitor your baby's health as well as your own. Congratulations, you're pregnant! Now it's time to be poked, prodded, monitored, measured and observed for about 40 weeks. The amount of medical testing that happens to a mother between and delivery can seem overwhelming -- but there are two lives at stake during this time, and it's vitally important to make sure they both remain healthy. By taking the right tests at the right times, you will be ensuring the best possible chance of that happening. This handy guide to the top 10 most important medical tests during pregnancy will help take some of the stress out of all of those doctor visits and let you get back to what truly matters -- enjoying the anticipation of bringing a new life into your family. Squeamish about having your blood drawn? Relax, if you can. It will make the whole process easier. One of the first tests you'll need when you become pregnant is a complete blood count or CBC. This measures a variety of factors in your blood, such as the number of white and red blood cells that you have. When you are pregnant, there are three important indicators your doctor will look for in your CBC test results: hemoglobin, hematacrit and your platelet count. Hemoglobin is a protein in the blood that delivers oxygen to your cells, and hematacrit is a measure of red blood cells in the body. If either of these counts are low, it may indicate anemia, and your doctor would recommend a course of treatment to address the condition. The platelets in your body are the substances that help your blood clot. It is critical that the platelet count be in the normal range because a woman looses a half liter of blood on average during pregnancy, and the platelets see to it that you don't lose any more than that [source: ]. If your count is unusually low, your doctor will conduct further tests to source the problem and administer treatment as appropriate. In addition to checking the cellular composition of the blood during the early stages of a pregnancy, doctors will also screen blood samples for such as HIV/AIDS, syphilis, herpes and hepatitis B and C. Additionally, a cervical swabbing will be used to check for gonorrhea and chlamydia. Discovering these diseases early on in a pregnancy is vital, as they can all be passed on to the fetus. Syphilis and HIV can infect the baby while it is still in the womb, while other diseases like chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and genital herpes can infect the baby during birth as it moves through the birth canal. STDs can cause a range of complications for a baby including transmission of the disease itself, early delivery, eye infections (from gonorrhea and chlamydia), or much more severe consequences such as miscarriage or stillbirth (from syphilis). In the case of HIV, medication can be given that reduces the risk of transmitting the disease to the baby from 25 percent to approximately 7 percent. Genital herpes, another viral infection, can't be cured, but doctors might recommend a C-section if a woman has an outbreak at the time of delivery. In the case of hepatitis B, if the virus was contracted early in the pregnancy, there is a less than 10 percent chance the disease will be transmitted to the baby. If it was contracted later in the pregnancy, the transmission rate increases to approximately 90 percent [source: ]. Chlamydia, syphilis and gonorrhea can be cured with baby-safe antibiotics. It's possible that both expecting parents will need to undergo the Rh Factor Test. Yet another test that's conducted on a pregnant woman's blood (and sometimes the father's blood, too) early in the pregnancy, the Rh (or Rhesus) factor test looks for a type of protein found on the surface of the red blood cells. If you have the protein -- as does approximately 85 percent of the population -- you're considered Rh positive and there is no potential issue [source: ]. If however, you lack the protein (Rh negative) and the father has it, complications can occur. This is because the baby can inherit Rh-positive blood from the father. If this happens and then a baby's blood mixes with the mother's, the mother's body could treat the baby like something to which it is allergic, and the immune system could attack the baby's blood, causing a condition in the child known as hemolytic anemia. It is rare for the blood of the fetus to mingle with the mother's blood during gestation however, so this condition is often a concern for second pregnancies. That's because intermingling of blood can occur during the first delivery and the next time an Rh-negative mother gets pregnant with an Rh-positive child, her antibodies will attack the fetus. This can be prevented by a simple vaccination around the 28th week of the pregnancy and again 72 hours after delivery of the first child. Pregnant women tend to need to urinate more than before they were pregnant. This isn't such a bad thing when it comes to medical testing, because your urine is likely to be sampled several times during your pregnancy. A urine test looks for certain markers in the fluid that can tell a doctor a great deal about the mother's health. Chief among these is the amount of sugar in the blood. If it is too high it could indicate , a condition that usually starts about halfway through the pregnancy. It is caused when pregnancy hormones stop insulin from removing sugars from the blood and can be corrected through diet and/or medication. Your doctor will also be looking for protein in the urine, which could indicate a kidney infection; bacteria, which would point to a urinary tract infection; and ketones which occur when the body uses fats instead of carbohydrates for energy and could mean you are dehydrated or undernourished. Some tests, like those conducted through blood and urine analysis, are absolutely essential to both the baby and the mother's health. Other tests, like Chorionic villus sampling (CVS), are usually optional. During a CVS test, which is usually done between the 10th and 12th weeks of pregnancy, a small group of cells is gathered from the placenta and analyzed for markers of conditions like Down Syndrome, Tay-Sachs disease, sickle-cell anemia and cystic fibrosis. The test is viable for women over 35 or anyone with a history of chromosomal abnormalities but there is a risk: approximately 1 in 100 women will miscarry as a result of the procedure [source: ]. An expectant mother's blood pressure is closely monitored throughout her pregnancy. In addition to checking for the conditions previously described, your doctor will also be looking for signs of a condition known as in your blood and urine. In the blood, this could be expressed by a low platelet count and in the urine, the presence of protein might indicate that the condition is present. Preeclampsia affects 7 percent of all pregnant women, especially first-time mothers and those carrying multiple children [source: ]. It is a rising of the blood pressure due to the pregnancy and typically happens late term. It can have serious health risks for both mother and child, such as a lack of blood flow to the placenta or placental abruption (the pre-delivery separation of the placenta from the uterus). If it is left untreated, it can advance to eclampsia, in which the mother can experience life-threatening grand mal seizures. This is why it is critical to closely monitor blood pressure throughout the pregnancy -- especially during the second half. But it's also important to realize that high-blood pressure alone does not mean preeclampsia is occurring. It must be verified with protein in the urine, as well. This is perhaps the one test during a pregnancy that both father and mother look forward to, because it gives them their first glimpse of their new child. In an ultrasound test, a lubricating jelly is applied to a woman's abdominal area and an ultrasound ""wand"" is guided across the surface of the skin. High-frequency sound waves are transmitted into the uterus and bounce back to return an image of the fetus. Although parents will remember the test as the first time they got to see their baby's heartbeat or find out the child's sex, doctors conduct fetal ultrasounds for other reasons as well. The test is useful for discovering the gestational age of the baby which helps plan pre-natal care and predict a delivery date. It also helps locate the fetus and make sure that it is properly situated in the uterus, not in the fallopian tubes, which would indicate a dangerous condition known as an ectopic pregnancy. Fetal ultrasounds additionally make sure the baby is growing correctly and help identify any fetal abnormalities, examine the placenta to make sure it is healthy, and let expecting parents know if they're only having one child or multiple births. Fetal ultrasounds are typically conducted in the first trimester of the pregnancy and then again about midway through, but they can be used more than that if need be, as they are a very safe testing mechanism. During a standard ultrasound, the images that appear on the monitor or the printout parents are often given to take home can look more like abstract art than an actual rendering of a growing baby. 3-D ultrasounds are changing that dramatically. In these tests -- which are becoming available around the country at a rapid pace -- sound waves are returned to the sonogram's wand from a variety of angles, instead of just bouncing straight back. This creates a much more accurate view of a fetus with depth to its physical features and makes the image recognizable, even by someone without special training. Multiple marker screening comes in two varieties: the triple screen test and the quad screen test. As you might imagine, the triple screen test looks for three substances in the blood produced by the fetus and/or placenta: alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and estriol. The quad screen adds the substance inhibin A (Inh-A) to the mix. By evaluating these substances in the blood at approximately the 15th to 20th week of pregnancy -- and combining them with factors such as the mother's age, weight and ethnicity -- doctors are looking for signs of either neural tube defects like anencephaly or spina bifida, or for markers that might indicated Down syndrome. The tests are about 80 percent accurate in predicting neural tube defects. The triple screen is approximately 60 percent accurate in spotting Down syndrome; the quad screen correctly identifies the condition 75 percent of the time [source: ]. Because of these relatively low percentages, and the fact that the tests tend to deliver high false-positives, if a doctor spots something amiss, she will likely recommend further testing such as an amniocentesis (see sidebar) or a sonogram (if you haven't had one already). Sometimes, abnormal results from these tests can be explained by the fact that the pregnancy is actually further along then previously thought, which a sonogram would discover. If a multiple marker screen test shows the possibility of problems with the fetus, a doctor might recommend an amniocentesis. In this procedure, a needle is inserted into the amniotic sac surrounding the fetus and a small amount of liquid is removed for analysis. There is, however, a risk to the test. Between one in 300 to one in 500 women will miscarry when the test is done in the second trimester. The risk is slightly higher when done earlier in the pregnancy [source: ]. Around the 24th to 28th week of pregnancy, your doctor will likely recommend a glucose challenge test (GCT) to see if you might be developing , a temporary condition in which insulin fails to break down enough glucose in the blood. The condition affects 2 to 5 percent of all pregnant women. If this test comes back positive, there is an approximately 30 percent chance that you have developed the condition and your doctor would conduct a glucose tolerance test (GTT) [source: ]. In this test, you are asked to drink a high-sugar liquid and then your blood is collected an hour later so that its sugar level can be measured. In about 15 to 23 percent of women, the blood sugar levels are indeed too high and a follow up three-hour GTT is scheduled, which typically rules out the condition [source: ]. If you do develop gestational diabetes, your doctor will work with you to develop a diet, exercise and possible insulin-supplementation plan. The condition nearly always ends after the baby is born. Streptococcus bacteria looks innocuous, but it can cause serious birth defects. Although it only affects approximately one in every 2,000 babies born in the U.S., the bacterial infection known as group B streptococcus (GBS) can have serious consequences, so doctors (and the CDC) recommend that all pregnant women be tested -- usually during the 35th to 37th week of their term [source: ]. The test is conducted through a vaginal and anal swab that checks for the bacteria, which is actually present in approximately 25 percent of all healthy women [source: ]. If the test comes back positive, there is a one in 200 chance that a baby will contract the disease during birth, which can lead to serious conditions like sepsis, pneumonia and meningitis. However, if antibiotics are administered intravenously during delivery, that risk drops to one in 4000 (source: ). Antiobiotics are particularly recommended for a woman whose water breaks more than 18 hours before delivery, who has a fever during labor, who goes into labor early, or who has a history of giving birth to a child who contracted the disease. During labor, your doctor will likely monitor the heart rate of your baby. Due to contractions, which temporarily limit the flow of oxygen to the fetus, the baby's heart rate will naturally change during . However, any changes that fall outside the normal range -- approximately 110 to 160 beats per minute -- could indicate that the baby is not getting enough oxygen overall, and steps would be taken to correct this [source: ]. For EFM, two belts are wrapped around the mother's abdomen -- one which measures the baby's heart rate and the other that measures contractions. Alternatively, internal monitoring may take place where an electrode is placed on the baby at the part nearest the cervix, which is usually the top of the head. For this type of monitoring, it is necessary for a woman's water to have broken. Very little is currently known about what or how fetuses see. HowStuffWorks looks at a study changing that.

In December 2006 in Britain, three babies were born from two separate wombs -- inside the same woman. Uterus didelphys -- or a double womb -- is a pretty rare condition. It affects anywhere from about one in 1,000 to one in 1 million women worldwide, and it sometimes occurs in families. No mother wants to have a difficult delivery or an unhealthy baby. Learn how to spot the signs of complications and, in some cases, find out what you can do about them. An embryo usually attaches to the upper part of the uterine wall, but sometimes implantation takes place in a lower location. The condition is called placenta previa and can interfere with a normal delivery. By A miscarriage is the ending of a pregnancy due to the premature delivery of the fetus before the 20th week of pregnancy. At this point, the fetus is not developed enough to survive outside the uterus on its own. By Anemia or an Iron Deficiency During Pregnancy and Childbirth Iron deficiency anemia--a lack of iron in the blood--occurs in about 20 percent of pregnant women in the United States.

Gestational hypertension and preeclampsia are two different conditions, where one is associated with high blood pressure and the other with high blood pressure and organ damage. Read this article to know the difference between the two. By: | Tags:        Blood pressure monitors might not be accurate. © Shutterstock During changes in your blood pressure could be a scary thing. While mild changes can be rectified with proper diet, care and medication but if the reading are always high it could have consequences. Elevated blood pressure could be detrimental to both maternal and foetal health. When it comes to talking about most people use the terms and interchangeably. However, in reality, they are two different conditions. Here we are trying to define these two conditions that are associated with maternal high blood pressure and what it exactly means.

Also Read - Pregnancy: Metal exposure may lead to preterm births and pre-eclampsia in pregnant women Preeclampsia is an advanced stage of gestational hypertension. Many women who suffer from gestational hypertension end up with preeclampsia. One could say that gestational hypertension is a precursor to preeclampsia. This happens when the blood sugar levels in an expectant mother increases after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The difference between gestational hypertension and preeclampsia is that the later is associated with signs of organ damage and traces of protein can be found in urine. Preeclampsia can affect the mother’s kidneys, liver, blood or brain. Untreated preeclampsia can lead to serious complications for mother and baby, including development of seizures (eclampsia). Previously, preeclampsia was diagnosed only if a pregnant woman had high blood pressure and protein in her urine. But doctors now suggest that it is possible to have preeclampsia without having protein in the urine. This is why it becomes necessary to take adequate steps to control blood pressure during pregnancy. Mothers who are at risk of developing gestational hypertension or preeclampsia are usually overweight, live a sedentary lifestyle, indulge in smoking or drinking, have a late pregnancy (is over 40) or have a family history of hypertension. High blood pressure during pregnancy can also affect the fetus in a number of ways – it can lead to decreased blood flow through the placenta compromising on oxygen and nutrient exchange, retarded growth, injury to developing organs, early labour among others. Keep a track of your blood pressure during pregnancy. If your doctor tells you that your numbers have increased, follow your doctor’s instruction to get back to the normal range. Try and cut down on salt and processed foods as they are known to increase your levels further. Eat a healthy balanced diet including a lot of fruits and vegetables that will help to cut down on your salt intake. Exercise to help your body sweat it out and excrete the extra salt.

0616841a-3e15-4c80-bae3-4b5199bec2f7,"/ Is your pregnancy high-risk? (Expert interview) Pregnancy can be a tricky time for both the mother and baby. Here is post on high risk pregnancies, and how you can identify them. By: | Tags:            Pregnancy can be a difficult time for most women. With morning sickness and nervousness all rolled into one, the stress of having a healthy baby can wreak havoc in a woman’s life. According to the UNICEF, 247 women died during child birth out of 100,000 live births between the year 2004-2006 in India and an equally large number of babies perished at birth as well. A number of reasons have been attributed to this sad statistic including prolonged labour, ill health, early pregnancies and malnutrition. So what could be going wrong? We spoke to , a renowned gynaecologist, about high risk pregnancies, how they are caused and how you can help identify and possibly prevent them from occurring. Here are excerpts from the interview: Also Read - Avoid sexual dysfunction: Having multiple partners may actually be good for you Also Read - Genes linked to common brain disorder, Chiari 1 malformation, identified Also Read - Estrogen can protect you from the flu: Boost levels of this hormone naturally A high risk pregnancy means a situation where there are certain factors that increase the likelihood of harm to mother or baby. There is no universally accepted definition of a ‘high-risk pregnancy’, but this is what it can be broadly defined as. Any woman can have a risky pregnancy but it generally occurs in women who are younger than 18 years and those older than 35 years of age. What a mother has to remember is that they should not live in the false belief that because they do not fall into the bracket I mentioned, they are not prone to the risks. It can happen to other women also. That is why they need to get checked by a doctor often during their pregnancy. How does a normal pregnancy become a high risk pregnancy? If a woman gets regular checkups, it is possible that her gynaecologist will detect the presence of impending complications. There are some red flags that should tip off the physician as well as the patient. They are: If the patient has associated health problems such as diabetes, high BP, kidney disease, epilepsy etc. If she has a history of multiple miscarriages or an infection such as HIV, hepatitis C etc. If the baby has a genetic condition such as Down’s syndrome or problems with its heart, lungs or kidneys. If the lady has been taking medicines such as dilantin, valparin or tegretol which are known to cause defects in the unborn baby. If the mother has associated heart valve problems, sickle cell disease, asthma, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis. If the patient experienced problems such as seizures or pre-term labor during previous pregnancies. Under all these cases the pregnancy may be classified as high risk What care should pregnant mothers take to avoid such a condition? Regular visits to the gynaecologist are the norm. The doctor will be able to look for development of any symptoms of medical disorders. Regular monitoring of the pregnancy by ultrasound and investigations helps detect such problems at an early stage. A mother-to-be should also remember to maintain a healthy lifestyle, have healthy eating habits, rest adequately and avoiding stress. () Once the gynaecologist identifies that the mother has some of the pre-existing conditions where she is likely to have a complicated pregnancy, he/she will screen the patient and the unborn child for any conditions that could complicate issues at the last moment. ( Pregnancy query of the day Abnormality seen in ultrasound) What are the complications of such a pregnancy? If a woman is diagnosed with having a serious medical condition during her pregnancy there are chances that she may have a miscarriage, there could be poor growth of the developing fetus, premature delivery and other complications. Can certain types of medication complicate a pregnancy? What should a mother avoid during this phase? There are certain medications like anti epileptic drugs which can cause genetic defects in the baby. I advise my patients to get pre-conceptional counseling. This is usually done by a by a gyaenacologist. A gynaecologist screens the patient prior to pregnancy for potential problems which may cause complications during the pregnancy and make sure they are managed prior to conception. Some of the common things that are done; is to replace more toxic drugs with milder ones prior to pregnancy so that the baby is affected as little as possible. If the patient is diagnosed with diabetes prior to pregnancy, treatment can be initiated so that during pregnancy things are under control with regular and close monitoring. Often people say that doctors do a caesarean section without allowing for a normal birth. How does a doctor decide between the two? This is not true. No doctor would like to do an unnecessary caesarean. Even we realize the potential complications of surgery in any patient. We decide to go for a caesarean based on the maternal condition during labor, if there are any associated high risk factors, if the baby is responding well to labor pains or showing signs of distress etc. Please remember a well planned and a well timed caesarean is any day better than a badly conducted vaginal delivery where the mother as well as the baby are in trouble due to prolonged labour.

a2f1bd0c-83b5-40ee-a640-20325ea5f482,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then . I know a thing or two about having a so-called high-risk . I’ll never forget when I first saw the term “elderly multigravida” on my medical record. There it was, confirming all my worst fears: Apparently, I was old, and of course dying of something very, very grave. Except that definitely wasn’t the case. I was, in fact, simply 35 and enjoying a healthy pregnancy with my second child. “Elderly,” in the language of obstetrics, refers to pregnant people who are 35 or over. (Multigravida means I had been pregnant more than once. If it were my first pregnancy, my code would have read “elderly primagravida.” Elderly multigravida, elderly primagravida—just as bad!) These are just a couple of the foreboding terms people who are pregnant over 35 must contend with. There’s also “advanced maternal age,” “geriatric pregnancy,” and, of course, the fact that I was considered “high-risk.” Am I being overly sensitive? As a health editor, I should be used to this, right? Or is age 35 really when your chances of having a start to drop? I had my first child at 33, my second at 36, and recently delivered my third at age 39. When I got pregnant at 32, I was one of the first of my friends to . The rest joined the club after age 35, echoing a national trend of waiting longer to start having children. “People might want to get their career going and wait a little while, or wait until they meet the right person,” Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale Medical School, tells SELF. Whatever the reason may be, times are changing when it comes to how long people are holding off before having children. (And advances in assisted reproductive technology, like , have made it easier for some people 35 and older to get pregnant than they could have in the past.) The average age at first childbirth rose to 26.9 years old in 2018, according to the (CDC), a marked increase from 24.9 years old in 2000. For context’s sake, in 1970, people first gave birth when they were 21.4 years old on average, so there’s a clear upward trend happening here. Experts are seeing national shifts when it comes to having children at age 35 and over, too. From 2000 to 2014, the number of women 35 and over giving birth for the first time climbed from 7.4 percent to 9.1 percent, the notes. Since then, it has generally continued to rise. In 2010, 45.9 out of every 1,000 women aged 35 to 39 gave birth, and in 2018, that number was up to 52.6 out of every 1,000 women aged 35 to 39, according to the . Clearly, more U.S. people than ever are delaying bringing little people into the world. But what does that mean about the odds of having a high-risk ? Is any pregnancy after age 35 automatically a high-risk pregnancy? Many doctors are quick to discount the belief that age 35 always and instantly draws a line between a healthy and a high-risk one. “We’ve learned that there’s nothing magic about age 35,” Sarah J. Kilpatrick, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Cedars-Sinai, tells SELF. “I would never tell someone that just because she’s 35 she has to see a high-risk doctor—only if there’s something in her history or something that happened during her pregnancy that warrants it.” According to Dr. Kilpatrick, the idea that being pregnant at 35 qualifies as a “geriatric pregnancy” seems to stem from outdated statistics about how getting pregnant at 35 or older raised the risk of various pregnancy complications. The truth about how the odds of these complications change with age (which we’ll get into further down) is much more nuanced than that. Some doctors even downplay this type of phrase to their patients. “I hate using the term ‘advanced maternal age,’” Dr. Minkin says, explaining that this kind of language can make people feel like they’re too old to be pregnant or they need to worry a ton about how age is affecting their pregnancy even if they’re completely healthy. With all of that (hopefully reassuring information) said, the chances of developing certain conditions or complications that can affect either you or the fetus or both start rising after age 35, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). But it’s not at all a guarantee that getting pregnant at 35 or older means something will go wrong. It does get harder to become and stay pregnant as you age. “That’s something to consider: [Pregnancy] rates tend to go down with age,” Dr. Minkin says. The chances of getting pregnant don’t decline as sharply once you hit 35 as you might have heard, but there is scientific reason to believe that’s when fertility starts to go down more quickly than before. The issue here basically comes down to your eggs, Dr. Minkin says, noting, “We’re born with all the eggs we’re going to have.” As you age, your number of viable eggs goes down, and this generally starts happening more rapidly once you turn 35. (.) Then there’s the fact that the odds of (losing a pregnancy before 20 weeks gestation) rise in pregnant people who are 35 and over, says. Around 80 percent of miscarriages happen in the first trimester, which is sometimes known as early pregnancy loss. Here are the rates of clinically recognized early pregnancy loss by age, per (keeping in mind that rates may be higher since early miscarriages sometimes go undetected): The reason for these rising rates becomes clearer when you understand that around 50 percent of early pregnancy losses happen because of chromosomal abnormalities with the fetus, according to . “[Our eggs] get older as we get older,” Dr. Minkin says. “In the process of eggs ripening and separating into gametes, which are the [cells] that get together to make babies, more abnormalities can happen … proportional to age.” , or losing a pregnancy after 20 weeks gestation, is unfortunately also more common after 35, says. and are exploring possibilities like an increased risk of issues with the placenta in pregnant people 40 and over. (The placenta is really important—it’s the organ that develops inside the womb during pregnancy to supply vital oxygen and essential nutrients to the fetus, the explains.) Some pregnancy-related health conditions become more common as you get older. “As we age, there is the potential for developing medical diseases; an aging woman who becomes pregnant is no exception,” Shannon Clark, M.D., a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and founder of , tells SELF. Gestational diabetes is a big here, Dr. Minkin says. It happens when high hormone levels in pregnancy make it harder for your body to produce enough insulin, a hormone from your pancreas that you need to regulate your blood sugar, explains, and it can develop even if you’ve never had diabetes before. Most importantly for the purposes of our discussion, the chances of developing gestational diabetes actually start rising in pregnant people over , according to the . This is more evidence that there’s really no one high-risk pregnancy age, 35 or otherwise, that definitely increases the risk of all complications. Although gestational diabetes doesn’t typically cause symptoms, when it does, they can include things like needing to pee more often and feeling thirstier than you usually do, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) explains. Gestational diabetes goes away after childbirth, although it can increase your risk of developing and afterward, and it also raises the risk of various childbirth complications like premature . Then there’s preeclampsia, which happens when someone who’s pregnant has high blood pressure and damage to important organs like the liver and kidneys, explains. Pregnant people 40 and over are at greater risk of developing this condition, which usually sets in after 20 weeks gestation (and even more often in the third trimester), but it can happen earlier than that and also . (Preeclampsia is also more likely to develop in people with gestational diabetes, notes.) Symptoms of preeclampsia can include a very high blood pressure reading, abnormally high protein levels in the urine (one common sign of this is very ), along with issues like sudden face or hand swelling, a severe headache, and vision changes, the says. , so it’s important to see a doctor as soon as possible if you’re concerned you may have it (or are concerned about anything else related to your health). Beyond that, complications from these kinds of issues can raise your chances of needing a , which, as a major surgery, comes with risks like infection and a higher likelihood of blood clots. Other potentially dangerous conditions that might call for C-sections include placenta previa, which happens when the placenta totally or fully blocks the cervix, and placenta accreta, when the placenta extends too far into the uterine wall. Both of these are more common in people 35 and older and can lead to issues like severe bleeding and preterm birth. Your doctor might also recommend a C-section if you’re carrying multiples, which—you guessed it—is more common in pregnancy over 35. (Interestingly enough, people 35 and older are more likely to release two or more eggs in one menstrual cycle, which can lead to multiples, explains.) That’s a lot of intimidating information to digest, but these are possibilities, not certainties. “Does that mean somebody should not get pregnant beyond the age of 35? Hell no,” Dr. Minkin says. “I’d be a bad example, having had my first kid at 36 and my second at 38.” If you’re over 35 and generally healthy, your pregnancy should be, too. This is why Dr. Minkin advises anyone who’s pregnant at 35 or after (and really anyone in general) to do their best to stay healthy with steps like exercising regularly. “We can never guarantee that someone won’t get [health issues like] gestational diabetes,” she says. But trying to lower your risk if you can puts the odds more in your favor. Ultimately, age by itself should not be major criteria for a high-risk pregnancy, says Dr. Kilpatrick. “It’s really age plus whatever else is going on with that woman.” So, Let’s Talk About That Whole Fertility and Age 35 Thing Lightning Crotch, Back Pain, and 6 Other Pregnancy Pains That Are Totally Normal 3 Times When Spotting During Pregnancy Could Signal a Problem SELF does not provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

60c34e29-2472-4b4d-88e0-8930dbcfba92,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then . 11 Health Conditions You Should Know About If You’re Black and Pregnant 11 Health Conditions You Should Know About If You’re Black and Pregnant This story is part of 's ongoing series exploring black maternal mortality. . As a black woman who hopes to become someday, statistics are scaring me into second-guessing my desires. Black women have three to four times higher risk of dying from pregnancy or childbirth-related complications than white women in the United States. Given this fact, I regularly swing between excitement about the prospect of being a mother and fear that I wouldn’t survive childbirth. Despite per capita on health care than any other industrialized nation, the United States has the highest maternal mortality rate of the industrialized world, according to the (CDC). Around 700 people in the United States die from pregnancy-related complications each year, the says. Another crushing statistic: About 60 percent of these pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. People who are black and pregnant or postpartum are most vulnerable to dying at this time regardless of factors like their income level and education. The maternal mortality rate for black non-Hispanic people is 42.8 deaths per 100,000 live births, according to the most recent data. White non-Hispanic people experience a much lower (yet still far too high) maternal mortality rate of around 13 deaths per 100,000 live births. (From this point on, when we use the terms “black” and “white,” we mean people of those races who are non-Hispanic.) Much of the work in preventing these deaths comes down to identifying and treating potentially dangerous health conditions before they have a chance to become lethal. Of those who die due to pregnancy-related complications, “a die during actual childbirth, about a third die within a week of having the baby, and the rest die up to a year later,” , M.D., founder and president of the National Birth Equity Collaborative, tells SELF. “So we're trying to ensure that people know about symptoms and signs before they get to the hospital.” With that said, it’s impossible to talk about the health of black pregnant and postpartum people without addressing racism in health care settings. It shouldn’t be on us to save ourselves. The onus really should be on health care providers to keep us safe, , M.D., assistant professor of the department of obstetrics and gynecology and associate director of Maternal-Fetal Medicine Program at NYU Langone Health, tells SELF. But discrimination in health care is a in racial maternal mortality disparities. as black people in the health care system doesn’t always work, but I do believe that knowing early warning signs of health issues can only help us in the fight to protect ourselves. We did not create the health inequities that plague us, but the more we understand the circumstances, the more equipped we are to navigate the unfair landscape in which we find ourselves. If you’re black and pregnant, hoping to one day become pregnant, or have recently had a baby, I hope this list of conditions you should know helps you feel a bit more in tune with your body, mind, and overall wellbeing. I know it can be scary to read through this, but the ultimate goal is to help empower you to advocate for yourself. If you’re experiencing any of the symptoms we mention or just don’t feel right, it’s important to seek medical help as soon as possible. is another term for high blood pressure. Your blood pressure is a measure of the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance in your arteries, according to the . The more blood your heart shunts around your body and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure climbs. Overall, black American women over the age of 20 are around one and a half times as likely to have hypertension than their white counterparts, according to the . Hypertension can be broken down into two other categories. There’s chronic hypertension, which occurs either before or within the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, and there’s gestational hypertension, which occurs after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). When you’re pregnant, your body’s already going through a roller coaster of changes that can put more stress on various critical systems. High blood pressure in pregnancy just exacerbates that, placing even more strain on organs like your heart and kidneys, says. If left unmanaged, this can eventually lead to some of the life-threatening conditions on this list. In addition to being black, hypertension risk factors include a family history of high blood pressure, being overweight or , a lack of physical activity, stress (as well as dealing with stress by using tobacco or drinking alcohol), and chronic conditions such as kidney disease and , the says. The tricky thing about high blood pressure is that it typically doesn’t have noticeable symptoms, according to the . When it comes to pregnancy, it’s most important to ask your ob/gyn how often you need to see them for check-ups so they can keep an eye on your blood pressure, especially if you already have hypertension or a cluster of the above risk factors. “Throughout pregnancy, you want to keep your regular prenatal appointments,” Dr. Brubaker says. We know that can be easier said than done. A lot of things can make it difficult to see your doctor regularly when you’re pregnant, like issues with transportation and getting time off of work. But voicing that concern can help your doctor try to come up with a manageable pregnancy care plan that actually makes sense for your life, like having you monitor your blood pressure at home, for instance. When left untreated, either type of hypertension to preeclampsia, though it’s more likely to happen with the chronic form, the says. This potentially dangerous condition involves high blood pressure along with damage to essential organs like the kidneys, explains. Preeclampsia usually begins after 20 weeks of pregnancy, though it can occur at any time, and black women are from preeclampsia complications than white women. As such, it’s really important for any black woman who is considering pregnancy or is currently pregnant to be aware of this condition, Dr. Brubaker says. Since preeclampsia can also happen in the postpartum period, it helps for anyone who’s recently given birth to be aware of it as well. Preeclampsia risk factors include being pregnant for the first time, having a family history of preeclampsia, having experienced preeclampsia in an earlier pregnancy, being obese, being over 40, and having chronic hypertension, kidney disease, or , according to . In severe cases, preeclampsia can devolve into HELLP syndrome, which explains stands for emolysis (damage to red blood cells), levated iver enzymes (a sign of liver damage), and ow latelet count (cells that help your blood clot). HELLP syndrome can be deadly. So can eclampsia, another condition that preeclampsia can cause if it’s not quickly discovered and treated. See your doctor immediately if you’re dealing with symptoms like unusual facial or hand swelling, a persistent and severe headache, eyesight changes like spotty or blurred vision, abdominal pain (particularly under your ribs on the right side), shoulder pain, shortness of breath, and decreased urination. Also be on the lookout for —in some cases it can signal excess protein in your urine, which can be a sign of kidney damage. Around one in 200 pregnant people with untreated preeclampsia will develop eclampsia, according to the . This is essentially preeclampsia with seizures, and it can lead to coma or even death. You can develop eclampsia without any obvious signs of preeclampsia, and even if you do show symptoms, you can progress from preeclampsia to eclampsia very quickly, often within a few days, Dr. Brubaker says. Additionally, while preeclampsia symptoms tend to lessen after delivery, about one-third of eclampsia cases actually happen people give birth, according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Unfortunately, as the notes, there aren’t really specific signs someone is in eclampsia territory besides seizures. Otherwise, eclampsia can cause similar symptoms as preeclampsia. Since those symptoms don’t always show up with either condition, this is another example of how important ongoing prenatal care is—especially if you’re black. Fibroids are benign tumors that form in or on the uterus, according to the . The fact that fibroids are non-cancerous is pretty much the only remotely good thing about them. Fibroids can cause issues like intense pain and worryingly . Sometimes (although this isn’t common), fibroids can even contribute to trouble getting pregnant or , according to the . And if someone with fibroids gets pregnant, they might be at higher risk of complications such as premature birth, smaller fetus size, and placental abruption (when the placenta, which provides nutrients to the fetus, separates from the wall of the uterus). Pregnancy hormones seem to encourage fibroids to get larger, the Merck Manual says, which could put you at higher risk of complications. These tumors are more prevalent in black women; about half develop symptomatic fibroids at some point compared with a quarter of white women, according to the Merck Manual. On top of that, black women tend to show more severe symptoms of fibroids and have them at younger ages than white women, Dr. Crear-Perry says. Many people don’t realize that they have fibroids. Even if you do have them, they won’t necessarily cause problems with pregnancy or childbirth. With that said, if you experience like heavy bleeding, intense cramping, a persistent urge to pee but also trouble fully emptying your bladder, and even a feeling of heaviness in your pelvis, you might want to talk to your doctor. As you might have guessed, is when someone who didn’t previously have diabetes develops it during pregnancy. This happens when your body has trouble making or using insulin, a hormone from your pancreas that helps you properly draw energy from glucose (sugar) in the foods you eat. It typically shows up around the 24th week of pregnancy, according to the . People of color—including black people—have a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes than white people do, according to the . For some people, gestational diabetes goes away after pregnancy without causing any issues. For others, it can contribute to pregnancy complications like high blood pressure, the says. Gestational diabetes can also increase your odds of having a baby that’s 9 pounds or more, which can then boost your risk of needing a , and of having a baby that’s born too early. Even if your gestational diabetes recedes after you give birth, it can raise both your and your baby’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes and (when blood sugar levels are higher than average but not yet high enough to be considered type 2 diabetes, the explains). Much like the above conditions, gestational diabetes doesn’t typically cause any symptoms, the says. The best thing you can do is talk to your doctor about it during routine prenatal visits and, if recommended, monitor your blood sugar levels throughout pregnancy, according to the . Regular contact with your doctor can help you catch any abnormalities before they turn into serious complications. Also called PPCM, this is a relatively rare form of heart failure that can set in between the last month of pregnancy and up to five months postpartum, according to the (AHA). It happens when the heart becomes too weak to pump enough blood throughout the body, which taxes organs like the lungs that need sufficient oxygen to do their jobs, the explains. Black pregnant people seem more vulnerable to this condition and also often fare worse if they develop it. A 2016 review in summarized much of the evidence on the subject, finding that over 40 percent of PPCM cases in nationwide studies happened in black people. Population studies in and showed PPCM incidence rates about three and four times higher in black people than in white people, respectively. It isn’t really known what causes peripartum cardiomyopathy, but some of the risk factors include being pregnant over the age of 30, a history of heart conditions, high blood pressure, obesity, excessive alcohol use, and smoking, according to the . Symptoms include fatigue, heart palpitations, peeing more at night, shortness of breath even when you’re lying down, feeling faint when you stand up, swollen ankles, and swollen neck veins, the says. If you’re thinking that a lot of that just sounds like regular pregnancy symptoms, you’re absolutely right. But it’s important to see a doctor anyway if these symptoms are worrying you. Your doctor can check your breathing to see if there are signs of fluid in your lungs, which could indicate that your symptoms extend beyond normal pregnancy woes, the says. Stroke can be lethal because it interrupts blood supply to the brain, according to the . This causes brain cells to die within minutes. While stroke alone is not overwhelmingly common during pregnancy, according to the , many of the conditions on this list put black pregnant people at greater risk for having a stroke. In fact, high blood pressure is the leading cause of stroke in pregnant and postpartum people, the says. Since black people are more susceptible to high blood pressure during pregnancy, it’s important to be aware that this can nudge up the risk of stroke, too. If your face, arms, or legs suddenly go numb or weak—especially if it only happens on one side of the body—you might be having a stroke, the says. Other symptoms include confusion, dizziness, trouble walking, severe headaches, and trouble speaking, understanding, or seeing. This potentially deadly complication happens when someone suffers severe blood loss after giving birth. “Anybody, even without certain conditions, can have a hemorrhage,” Dr. Brubaker says. “Even a young woman who has had a vaginal birth that seemed uncomplicated can have a life-threatening hemorrhage.” With that said, a 2018 study in the points to black people being most at risk. The study, which analyzed 360,370 people who experienced postpartum hemorrhage from 2012 to 2014, found that 121.8 black people out of every 100,000 who gave birth died due to postpartum hemorrhage, compared with 24.1 white people per 100,000 who gave birth dying from the same cause. The most common reason for postpartum hemorrhage is uterine atony, according to the (AAFP). This is when the uterus doesn’t contract enough after labor, the explains. Other issues like long, complicated labor, uterine tearing, and uterine inversion (when the uterus actually turns upside down) can also cause hemorrhaging, the says. Because most postpartum hemorrhage happens during or right after delivery, there aren’t many symptoms for to look for. Diagnosis and treatment hinge on your care team realizing that you’re bleeding too much and taking immediate steps to solve the problem. There are, however, rare instances of a condition called delayed postpartum hemorrhage, Dr. Brubaker says, which can cause bleeding within the first 12 weeks after delivery. When we say rare, we mean estimated to occur in of all pregnancies. Some bleeding after childbirth is completely normal, but if you go through more than one pad in an hour, call your doctor or go back to the hospital, Dr. Crear-Perry says. Venous thromboembolism describes the dangerous phenomenon of having blood clots in your veins, the explains. When these blood clots happen in one of the veins deeper in the body (typically in the legs or arms), it’s called . In what’s known as pulmonary embolism, this type of clot can break off and travel into the lungs, where it can block off blood supply. This can be life-threatening. What’s more, some research on the subject suggests that black people are most vulnerable to venous thromboembolism, with a 30 to 60 percent higher risk of this potentially dire health issue than white people. Getting pregnant can make you around five times more likely to wind up with a blood clot, the says. This is because during pregnancy and delivery, your blood clots more easily to lessen blood loss and the risk of conditions like postpartum hemorrhage, the explains. Your growing uterus can also compress blood vessels that would normally help keep blood flowing from your lower legs up through your body, which gives that blood more of a chance to pool in your limbs. This blood clot risk is heightened through pregnancy and into the first three months after delivery. Other blood clot risk factors include a personal or family history of blood clots or a blood clotting disorder, having a C-section or any other major surgery, and limited physical activity (like when you’re on bed rest or in recovery from a C-section), according to the . Chronic medical conditions that are more likely to impact black people, like and diabetes, can also play a role. Symptoms of deep vein thrombosis show up in the affected limb, like your arm or leg, the says. They include swelling, pain, warmth, redness, and discoloration, according to the . If you have a pulmonary embolism, you might be dealing with trouble breathing, pain that gets worse when you take a deep breath or cough, a racing or irregular heartbeat, and even coughing up blood. Any birth that occurs before 37 weeks is considered preterm, the explains. Preterm birth can be deadly for babies, and those who survive are at higher risk of issues like respiratory problems and developmental delays. This is a prevalent and worrisome health issue; around 1 in 10 babies were born too early in 2017, according to the . Black people are a shocking 50 percent more likely to have a preterm birth than white people are, according to data. Preterm birth can happen for a number of reasons, like a history of going into labor too early, being pregnant with multiples, smoking, substance use disorder, and having less than 18 months between pregnancies, the says. Some of the health issues on this list can also contribute to preterm birth, including preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. A 2019 study published in aimed to explore the relationship between maternal morbidity and preterm birth. Using birth rate data from the California Office of Statewide Planning, researchers looked at rates of preterm birth (876 per 10,000 births) and severe maternal health complications (140 per 10,000 births), finding that 1 in 270 births had both preterm delivery and severe maternal health issues. The researchers also emphasize that, just as with the other conditions on this list, racism has to be part of the conversation here. “The posits that there's accumulative stress on the body from exposure to structural factors like racism and discrimination,” , Ph.D., R.C.N., lead author on the preterm birth and maternal complication study and assistant dean of clinical research at NYU Rory Myers College of Nursing, tells SELF. “There [are] a lot of folks that see that as a strong factor in the patterning that we see in preterm birth and other health outcomes in the black population in particular.” Preterm labor is the same as regular labor, it just starts before 37 weeks. Signs include contractions every 10 minutes or more, leaking a lot of fluid or blood from the vagina, and the sensation that the baby is pushing down. People in preterm labor may also experience a dull ache in their lower back and abdominal cramping that may or may not include diarrhea, the says. 11. Postpartum depression, anxiety, and other mental health conditions There is rightfully a lot of focus on making sure that black pregnant people can have physically safe and healthy birthing experiences. But that can make it easy to sideline in this space, even though it’s just as crucial for wellbeing. And with all the changes a new baby can bring, it can be even easier to miss the signs of serious mental health conditions like and anxiety, along with less common conditions like . According to a of 27 states, around one in nine people experience symptoms of postpartum depression. Data on postpartum anxiety isn’t as robust, but what research does exist suggests it may actually be more common than postpartum depression. A 2013 study in found that 17 percent of the 1,123 postpartum people studied showed signs of postpartum anxiety compared to 6 percent who exhibited symptoms of postpartum depression (and 3.7 percent who showed signs of both). More research is necessary to confirm just how common both of these conditions may be. (This study also had limitations, like only looking at people who intended to breastfeed.) According to the (NIMH), black people aren’t inherently more likely to experience mental disorders than other populations, but they can be more vulnerable to barriers to care, which can make it harder to seek help, such as a lack of insurance or culturally competent providers, and , according to the (APA). The stress of a new baby, a lack of support, and logistical challenges in seeking care can contribute to issues like postpartum depression and anxiety, Dr. Crear-Perry says. “[It] can be hard for women to sort out what's normal from what's a real problem,” Dr. Brubaker says. How are you supposed to separate regular mood shifts or worries that can come with caring for a baby from something that might be more serious? Let’s start with postpartum depression. The symptoms can involve those of non-postpartum depression, like a sad mood that lasts for over two weeks, feelings of hopelessness, and a loss of interest in things that would typically bring you joy, according to the . On top of that, postpartum depression can lead to crying more than usual, being angry, feeling disconnected from your baby, doubting your ability to take care of your baby, and thinking about causing harm to yourself or the baby, according to the . Most importantly, you don’t need to have all of these symptoms to justify getting help. Worrying can also be a feature of postpartum depression, but it’s the hallmark of . If you’re experiencing such an intense level of worry or fear after having a baby that it’s hard for you to go about life as normal (or as close to normal as possible as a new parent), that could be a sign of postpartum anxiety. Ultimately, if you’re feeling any of these emotions (or any of the above physical symptoms we mentioned) reach out to your doctor to talk through what you’re feeling. All pregnant people and new parents deserve to be safe, happy, and healthy—black ones included.

Published on Jan 07, 2019 and last reviewed on Aug 31, 2019   -  8 min read Pregnancy is the time taken for a fetus to develop inside a woman’s womb. Sometimes, if more than one embryo develops inside the uterus at the same time, it is known as a multiple pregnancy. Pregnancy is the time taken for a fetus to develop inside a woman’s womb. Sometimes, if more than one embryo develops inside the uterus at the same time, it is known as a multiple pregnancy. It typically lasts for 40 weeks from the last menstrual period (LMP). A woman can get pregnant through sexual intercourse or by Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART). : Ovulation is the process where an egg is released from the ovaries. Ovulation normally occurs between the 11th to 21st day of your menstrual cycle. If you have sexual intercourse around the ovulation period, the chances of sperm fertilizing the egg increase many folds. To know when you ovulate, chart your basal body temperature (BBT). You can also use over-the-counter ovulation predictor kit or to know when you are ovulating. : Being overweight or underweight may affect the hormonal balance and disrupt ovulation. Your BMI (body mass index) should be between 18.5 to 24.9. Walking, swimming, yoga, etc., can be done to stay fit. Stress can make it harder for you to get pregnant. Try meditation, yoga, and acupuncture to de-stress yourself. Medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, asthma, etc., can affect your chances of getting pregnant. So, consult your doctor and get them treated to increase your chance of conceiving. Men can also improve their reproductive health by quitting smoking, eating healthy, stress management, limiting alcohol consumption, etc. prevents neural birth defects. Neural birth defects like spina bifida affect the baby’s brain and spinal cord. So, taking 400 mcg of Folic acid from at least a month before conception might reduce the incidence of such defects. A rise in the basal body temperature. You can note the change in temperature by measuring your BBT every morning with a thermometer. Before ovulation, a women’s BBT is between 36.1 to 36.4 degree Celsius, and after ovulation, it rises to 37 degrees. Levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) is higher. It can be measured using an ovulation kit. A few symptoms of pregnancy are noticeable early on, these symptoms include: If you develop any of the above symptoms, it is best you done. Pregnancy tests usually detect the presence of hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) hormone in the blood and urine. This hormone is produced after implantation. Pregnancy tests are negative, but am still having pregnancy symptoms. Why? Pregnancy test had two mildly visible lines, but it is now negative. Please suggest. I had sex with my partner last month and missed periods. Am I pregnant? It can be either done at home or in a doctor’s office. It is best to wait a week after a missed period to take this test. A chemical in the pregnancy strip changes color when it comes in contact with hCG hormone. Many pregnancy test strips are available over-the-counter, and you can follow the instructions provided with the kit. Blood tests are more accurate than the urine test, and can detect pregnancy as early as 6 to 6 days after ovulation. A quantitative or a qualitative hCG test can be carried out. -This just detects the presence of hCG in the blood, and gives a yes or no result. - It measures the levels of hCG hormone in the blood. This test is very accurate and can even detect smaller amounts of hCG in the blood. : Depending on the blood test results, your doctor will conduct an ultrasound or sonogram around the 6 to 8 weeks of pregnancy. You can see the developing embryo in this ultrasound image. Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, the first, second, and the third trimesters. Weeks 1 to 12 is the first trimester. It includes the process of fertilization, that is the process of sperm and ova forming an embryo in the fallopian tube. This embryo then travels down and reaches the uterus and gets attached to the wall of the uterus (implantation). This is the period where the embryo and placenta start to grow in the womb.By around 4 to 5 weeks, your baby’s heart, brain, and spinal cord start forming. Arm and leg buds can be seen. By 8 weeks, all major organs and external body structures start forming. The developing heart begins to beat in a regular rhythm. The umbilical cord is clearly visible, and the fetus is an inch long and looks more like a human. And by the 12th week, the nerves and muscles form and work together. The external sex organs start developing, and the eyelids close to protect the developing eyes. At the end of 12 weeks, the fetus is approximately 3 inches long. Your body undergoes many changes, and hormonal changes affect almost all the organs of your body. The first sign of pregnancy is your periods stopping. The symptoms of pregnancy can start from the first week itself, but some women might not feel any discomfort at all. Weeks 13 to 28 is the second trimester. Majority of pregnant women find this trimester easier than the first. The baby starts growing, and your abdomen and uterus expand with it. By the end of this trimester, you can feel your baby move inside you.Generally, by the end of the 16th week, muscle and bone grow and form a complete skeleton, and transparent skin begins to form. The baby’s first bowel movement (meconium) develops in their intestinal tract. By the 20th week, the developing fetus is covered with fine hair (lanugo). The baby becomes more active, and you can feel slight fluttering movements. Eyebrows, eyelashes, and nails form. At 24 weeks, the bone marrow starts making blood cells. Fingerprints, footprints, and taste buds develop. Hair starts growing, and the sex organs develop. By the end of the second trimester, the fetus is approximately 12 inches long. To make room for the growing baby, you may undergo the following body changes:Pain in the back, abdomen, and thigh. A line can be seen from the belly button to the pubic hair. The skin over the cheeks, lips, forehead, and nose get dark in patches. Weeks 29 to 40 is the third trimester. It is the final stage of pregnancy. As the baby grows, it might put more pressure on your internal organs. You might have difficulty breathing and might urinate frequently. These problems should go away after you give birth.By the 32nd week, your baby’s bones are soft but fully formed. As a result, their kicks and jabs are more forceful. The fine hair covering their body falls off. The eyes open and close and can sense changes in light. At 36 weeks, the body fat increases and protective wax coating (vernix) gets thicker. Your baby is about 16 to 19 inches long. At 39 weeks, your baby is considered full-term. The baby’s organs are fully formed and can function on their own. The discomforts felt during the second trimester may continue, also the following symptoms may be present: The due date or estimated date of delivery (EDD) is the expected date of delivery for pregnant women. A normal pregnancy lasts for 280 days, and it is . Normal labor starts as early as three weeks before or two weeks after the due date. The following are the signs of labor: As the baby’s head drops down into the pelvis, your belly might look lower. You will find it easy to breathe. Frequent urination as the baby presses on the bladder. Brownish mucus plug is discharged from the cervix. When the amniotic sac surrounding the baby ruptures, fluid can be seen leaking from the vagina. It usually occurs 24 hours before women go into labor. Contractions which occur less than 10 minutes apart is a sign of labor. - Vaginal delivery is the oldest, most common, and the safest kind of birth. It may or may not be assisted with pain medications or epidural injection. In certain circumstances, when the baby is unable to emerge out entirely, and if the mother is tired, then vaginal delivery is assisted with the help of a forceps (forceps delivery) or vacuum (Vacuum extraction). - If any complications arise during vaginal delivery, c-section is done. In this method, the abdomen is surgically opened by placing a c shaped cut, and the baby is delivered by surgically cutting into the uterus.Once a woman has a cesarean delivery, all future deliveries are performed by c-section, as there is a change of the uterus rupturing during vaginal delivery. But nowadays, depending on how your previous c-section was performed, you might have a chance to give birth vaginally this time! Some of the difficulties seen during pregnancy are: – Women with no previous history of diabetes, develop high blood sugar during the gestational period. – Severe and persistent vomiting is called hyperemesis gravidarum. It can cause dehydration and weight loss. – It is a disorder that causes pain due to the instability and limited mobility of the pelvic joints. – during pregnancy is called gestational hypertension. Blood pressure above 160/110 is called preeclampsia. – The levels of hemoglobin is low in most of the pregnant women during the third trimester. – DVT is the formation of blood clot in the deep veins, mostly the veins of the leg. It can be fatal. – It is the decrease in the heart function during the last months of pregnancy. – Hashimoto’s disease causes the mother’s thyroid not to function properly and might cause severe congenital disabilities in the child. – When the fertilized embryo gets attached outside the uterus, it is called ectopic pregnancy. – Loss of pregnancy in the first 20 weeks is called a miscarriage.Placental abruption – The separation of the placenta from the uterine wall is called placental abruption. – It is when the placenta gets attached near or over the cervical opening in the uterus. – It occurs when the placenta gets abnormally attached to the muscular layer of the uterine wall. – As the developing fetus has no immune system, pathogens can cross the placental barrier and cause infections. - If your cervix starts to dilate and you have regular contractions before you reach 37 weeks, it is known as premature labor. Pregnancy is a significant time during a woman's life. It is crucial to take care of yourself during these 9 months, as any changes in the health will have a direct effect on the developing fetus.

""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. An estimated 585,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related causes (World Health Organization and UNICEF, 1996). Such estimates have raised awareness of the fact that women still die in what is perceived by most to be a healthy process (Rosenfield and Maine, 1985). Since there are approximately 180 million pregnancies each year, the overall view of a healthy process is reasonable, but that view hides the huge disparity between women in developed and developing countries: about 1 in 48 women in developing countries dies of complications of pregnancy, delivery, puerperium, or abortion, compared with only 1 in 1,800 in developed countries; see . The risk of dying is highest for women in Africa, for two reasons: on average, they are pregnant and deliver more frequently than women on other continents and each pregnancy is riskier. Because of its much higher population, though, the majority of maternal deaths each year take place in Asia. The consequences of a maternal death for a woman's family are also profound: if she dies, the chance of death for her children under the age of 5 is as high as 50 percent in developing countries (World Bank, 1993). The causes of maternal mortality are divided into direct causes, those which occur only during pregnancy and the peripartum period, and indirect ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING.""

TABLE 5-1 Maternal Mortality by Major Regions, Circa 1990 Maternal Mortality Ratio (deaths per 100,000 live births) SOURCES: Data from World Health Organization and UNICEF (1996) and United Nations (1996). ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. causes, those that are aggravated by pregnancy but may be present even before pregnancy, such as diabetes, malaria, or hepatitis. Approximately 80 percent of all maternal deaths are estimated to be due to direct causes (World Health Organization, 1996). The World Health Organization (WHO) (1993c) estimates that hemorrhage is the most common direct cause, followed by sepsis and complications of unsafe abortion, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including eclampsia), and obstructed labor. The relative importance of different direct causes of mortality varies among studies, due in part to differences in reporting and definitions, and in part to real differences in the quality and accessibility of delivery care. Although the definition of a maternal death includes a woman's death while pregnant or up to 42 days postdelivery from any cause (except accidental), most maternal deaths, excluding abortion-related deaths, occur during labor and delivery or soon thereafter. In a rural area of Bangladesh, for example, more than 70 percent of the nonabortion deaths occur in this short time span: 40 percent during labor or within 48 hours of delivery (primarily due to eclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage) and 30 percent between 3 and 42 days postdelivery, with sepsis and associated diseases leading the list of causes (Fauveau et al., 1988). Extending the definition of maternal death to 90 days postpartum, as has been proposed, would only have increased the number of maternal deaths by 6 percent. The critical period as that of labor and delivery is also supported by a nationally representative study in Egypt (Ministry of Health, 1994): 39 percent of deaths took place during delivery or within the first 24 hours, and 36 percent occurred within 42 days postpartum; only 25 percent took place during pregnancy itself. Between 30 and 40 percent of pregnant women, or over 54 million women in developing countries, are estimated to experience a pregnancy-related complication annually (World Health Organization, 1993b; Koblinsky, Campbell, and Harlow, 1993). WHO estimates that 15 million women per year develop long-term disabilities from such complications as obstetric fistula, prolapse, severe anemia, pelvic inflammatory disease, and reproductive tract infections, as well as infertility. At the country level, these estimates vary widely. For example, in community-based studies, Guatemalan women reported one in five pregnancies as complicated (Bailey, Szaszdi, and Schieber, 1994); in West Java, one in three women reported complications, not including those experienced in the postpartum period (Alisjahbana et al., 1995); and in Ghana, two of every three pregnant women had some complication, although the ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. serious complications were infrequent (postpartum bleeding, 7 percent, convulsions, 2 percent, and postpartum sepsis, 5 percent (De Graft-Johnson, 1994). A population-based survey in El Salvador found one serious complication alone—intense intrapartum bleeding to the point of losing consciousness—was reported by nearly one-quarter of rural women (Danell et al., 1994). When the definition of complications is broadened to include perineal laceration, prolonged labor not leading to cesarean section, breech, multiple births, retained placenta, and other less severe complications, one-half of women in the Philippines reported a complication, with the most common being perineal lacerations (43% of respondents) (National Statistics Office and Macro International, Inc., 1994). Reliability and validity of self-reported data on complications and their comparability across studies are likely to be poor (Task Force on Validation of Women's Reporting of Obstetric Complications, 1997). In a validation study undertaken at the Philippine General Hospital, Stewart and Festin (1995) developed algorithms based on reported symptoms to identify women most likely to have experienced hemorrhage, eclampsia, severe infection, and cesarean section due to obstructed labor. The algorithms were then used to identify women in the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) sample likely to have suffered life-threatening maternal complications: 12 percent of all women in the sample were identified (National Statistics Office and Macro International, Inc., 1994). Hemorrhage was the most common complication (8%), followed by cesarean section due to obstructed labor (3%), severe infection (2%), and eclampsia (1%). The overall estimate is close to the 15 percent of women estimated to suffer ''serious"" complications based on data from the United States and Canada (Koblinsky, Campbell, and Harlow, 1993; World Health Organization, 1994b). If 12-15 percent of women suffer life-threatening obstetric complications, then approximately 20 million women in developing countries warrant referral care each year. Millions more women suffer associated illnesses that are aggravated by pregnancy—anemia, malaria, cardiac disease, hepatitis, tuberculosis or diabetes—that can indirectly cause death or further disability for the woman or newborn. WHO estimates conservatively that 12.5 million women each year are affected by these illnesses aggravated by their pregnancies (World Health Organization, 1993b; Koblinsky, 1995). Approximately 20 percent of all maternal deaths in all regions are attributed to these indirect causes (World Health Organization, 1993b). Furthermore, the nonfatal consequences of obstetric complications and associated diseases can severely affect women's quality of life, fertility, productivity, and can result in chronic reproductive morbidities that may become evident only long after delivery. ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. Given its high prevalence and impact on the lives and survival chances of women and newborns, anemia (hemoglobin counts below 11 g/dl) deserves special mention. Dietary iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia, although malaria, other parasites (schistosomiasis and hookworm), AIDS and sickle-cell diseases may also contribute. Approximately 50 percent of pregnant women throughout the world are estimated to be anemic. A United Nations expert panel considers severe anemia (below 7 g/dl) an associated cause in up to half of maternal deaths worldwide (United Nations, 1991). Severe anemia may be directly associated with maternal morbidity and mortality, although available data do not often allow one to distinguish mild and severe anemia. The impact of maternal anemia on the outcome of pregnancy—prematurity, stillbirths, spontaneous abortions, perinatal and neonatal mortality—is well documented (Levin et al., 1993). In a sample of 4,434 births in a northern Nigerian hospital, when maternal hematocrit levels measured 2 weeks before delivery were below 18 percent (the cutoff for severe anemia is 23%), nearly 50 percent of the births were stillbirths, and another 15 percent of newborns died in the neonatal period. When hematocrits were between 19-25 percent, stillbirths accounted for 22 percent of all births (Harrison, 1985). Two large studies, one in the United States and the other in Wales, found a U-shaped relationship between hemoglobin levels and the risk of low birth weight, prematurity, and perinatal mortality (Garn et al., 1981; Murphy et al., 1986). In both studies, hemoglobin levels below 10 g/dl and above 13 g/dl were associated with these poor birth outcomes. One study from Nigeria implicates even mild anemia in 45 percent of maternal deaths of women who also suffered a major obstetric complication (Harrison, 1985). Iron-deficient women have an increased risk of complications during pregnancy, including urinary tract infections, pyelonephritis, and pre-eclampsia (Kitay and Harbort, 1975). Laboratory studies and studies with children have linked iron deficiency with increased morbidity from infectious diseases due to impaired immune function, although this would not explain the association with pre-eclampsia (Srikantia et al., 1976; Stinnett, 1983; Bhaskaram and Reddy, 1975; Enwonu, 1990). Anemia is also associated with reduced capacity to work, affecting both women's productivity and their quality of life (Bothwell and Charlton, 1981). Besides anemia caused by iron deficiency, folate deficiency, which causes megaloblastic anemia, is also common in developing countries. This deficiency may have independent effects on birth weight, preterm birth, and possibly, neural tube defects in newborns (Hughes, 1991). ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. Other common micronutrient deficiencies—particularly iodine and vitamin A—are also known to have similar negative pregnancy outcomes. Two chronic conditions warrant attention because of their high prevalence and devastating consequences—obstetric fistula and genital prolapse. An obstetric fistula is a passage in the vaginal wall leading into the bladder (vesico-vaginal fistula), the rectum (recto-vaginal fistula), or both. In developing countries where it has been reported, fistula is associated with prolonged and obstructed labor. Those at high risk of fistulas include very young women of low parity; women whose growth has been stunted by nutritional deficiency and recurrent infection in childhood that led to growth stunting; women in rural areas where health care is not accessible because of distance, lack of transport, and poverty; and women who prefer and have used traditional care and home delivery many times (Lawson, 1992; Murphy, 1981; Mustapha and Rushwan, 1971; Tahzib, 1983). A traditional practice in northern Nigeria, the gishri cut (the cutting of the anterior of the vagina as a way of treating a number of conditions, including obstructed labor, infertility, dyspareunia, and amenorrhea) further contributes to the risk of fistulas (Tahzib, 1983, 1985). Good estimates of the prevalence of obstetric fistulas are impossible because the affected women do not seek or get care at hospitals, and health interview surveys have not elicited data on the condition. The available reports of fistula in developing countries come from most countries of sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia (World Health Organization, 1991; Lawson, 1992). The consequences of fistulas are devastating, especially for primiparas (women in their first pregnancies). In most cases, the baby is stillborn. The woman becomes incontinent of urine and sometimes of feces, uncomfortable conditions producing a foul odor and leading to feelings of shame and disgrace. The woman may not know about treatment, or she may be unable to seek professional help. Once the condition is seen as chronic, she is often deserted by her husband and has to seek support within her own family. Even there, she is usually segregated and not allowed to participate in certain activities, such as food preparation. In Islamic cultures, the woman may be forbidden to pray because of the requirement of cleansing oneself for prayer, which her condition of incontinence does not allow (Women's Global Network for Reproductive Rights, 1991; Murphy, 1981). Also borne silently in most countries is genital prolapse, often considered a normal consequence of childbearing. Occurring when the vagina and uterus descend below their normal positions, this condition is associated ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. with high parity and is often the result of damage during childbirth to the muscles and ligaments that support those organs. Genital prolapse is extremely uncomfortable, particularly for women who undertake chores in a squatting position, as is common in low-income and rural settings in developing countries. Prolapse may also be accompanied by backache (Younis et al., 1994) or urinary problems (Otubu and Ezem, 1982). Sexual intercourse may be painful, and pregnancy can lead to fetal loss and further maternal morbidity (Younis et al., 1994; Das, 1971). As with fistula, there are no reliable large-scale population-based estimates of the prevalence of genital prolapse. A Brazilian hospital study revealed that 40 of every 1,000 women coming to a university hospital for other reasons suffered severe genital prolapse (Pinotti, Brenelli, and Moragues, 1993). Community-based studies have found between one-third and two-thirds of women with prolapse in Lahore, Pakistan, Istanbul, Turkey, and in two rural villages in Giza, Egypt (Omran and Standley, 1981; Younis et al., 1993). Clinically confirmed severe prolapse was found in almost one-third of the women in a study in Giza, Egypt; many were found to be using an intrauterine device (IUD) for contraception despite the fact that IUDs increase the discomfort of the prolapse (Zurayk, Younis, and Khattab, 1995). The Giza study also revealed an association between prolapse and reproductive tract infections (Younis et al., 1993). The impact of women's reproductive health on the fetus or newborn is immediate and dramatic. An estimated 7.6 million perinatal deaths (stillbirths and first-week deaths) occur each year in developing countries (World Health Organization, 1996). These perinatal deaths are associated to a large extent with their mothers' health and nutritional status prior to and during pregnancy, the management of labor and delivery, and the same maternal complications that can cause women's deaths. About one-half of all deaths of children under age 5 occur in their first month of life. Population-based studies in South Asia and the Philippines suggest that approximately 20-25 percent of perinatal deaths are associated with causes known to threaten the survival of women during pregnancy or delivery, another 20 percent are due to management practices at delivery, and more than one-third are due to women's health and nutritional status (Shah, Pratinidhi, and Bhatlawande, 1984a, 1984b; Fauveau et al., 1990; National Statistics Office and Macro International, Inc., 1994). Programs aimed at improving women's health and nutritional status and at managing obstetric complications and providing appropriate care of the newborn ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. could reduce this enormous death toll (World Health Organization, 1994a). The consequence of a mother's health and nutritional status, management of delivery, and early newborn care may not be death for the infant, but long-term disability. Obstructed or prolonged labor leads to asphyxia for an estimated 3 percent of newborns, resulting not only in death for nearly a one-quarter of these infants, but also in brain damage leading to cerebral palsy, seizures, and severe learning disorders for another quarter (World Health Organization, 1993b). Women with poor nutritional status (short stature, poor prepregnancy weight, inadequate weight gain during pregnancy, and anemia) or reproductive tract infections or other infections during pregnancy are more likely to have low birth-weight infants. The perinatal mortality rate of a low birth-weight baby is 20 to 30 times higher than that of a fetus or infant of normal weight. Many low birth-weight infants who do not die may suffer serious neurological problems, hearing and visual defects, and may be subject to slow development throughout their lives. The most immediate pathway to maternal death begins with conception. The major complications that cause maternal death may be present initially in a mild form, progressing to severe complications in some 12-15 percent of all pregnancies. Interventions can stop this progression at several points: prevent diseases that will complicate pregnancy or detect and treat early signs of complications, and treat complications at the mild or severe level with ""essential care of obstetric complications."" Prevention and Early Treatment of Diseases and Complications Prenatal care is primarily preventive, enabling health care staff to identify problems and illnesses that threaten a pregnancy and its outcome, to monitor and treat some conditions, and to give the pregnant woman and her family information about appropriate diet, behaviors, and delivery care. Most studies of the effectiveness of prenatal care have focused on infant outcomes—perinatal mortality, preterm delivery, and low birth weight. But an association between use of prenatal care and maternal mortality has also been found in hospital case series, case-control studies, ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. and informal surveys, although it is argued that this association is due to selection bias—that is, the women who use prenatal services are also more likely to take better care of themselves and use delivery services (Rooney, 1992). The major direct causes of maternal deaths in developing countries can neither be predicted nor prevented (Maine, 1991; Thaddeus and Maine, 1994). Prenatal care may be effective in detecting and treating two conditions that underlie the direct medical causes of maternal and perinatal death: anemia and hypertension. For the mother, one of the most important benefits of prenatal care can be the provision of information about obstetric emergencies and linkage to sources of care. For this reason, it is best to consider prenatal care and delivery and early postpartum care as parts of a whole, rather than as separate interventions. The benefits of adequate prenatal care for the health of the infants are somewhat clearer, but difficult to evaluate, because women who get inadequate prenatal care are more likely to have other risk factors for poor pregnancy outcomes (Kramer, 1987). Some observational studies with reasonable controls for confounding variables have found that better prenatal care is associated with such improved outcomes as lower rates of intrauterine growth retardation and premature delivery (e.g., Coria-Soto, Bobadilla, and Notzon, 1996). Tetanus toxoid immunization during pregnancy has been crucial in reducing neonatal and maternal tetanus (Fauveau et al., 1990). Screening for, and treating, syphilis during pregnancy is beneficial to both mothers and infants. Predicting those pregnancies that will go on to suffer mild or severe complications on the basis of risk factors (as opposed to medical signs or symptoms of complications) has not proved useful. Demographic factors, such as age, parity, or a combination thereof, have not proved to be sensitive and specific enough. In a Philippines' population-based survey, for example, background characteristics of respondents reporting symptoms of major obstetric complications for births in the past 3 years revealed minimal variation among the age or parity groups, suggesting that these demographic indicators are inadequate predictors of risk of an obstetric complication (National Statistics Office and Macro International, Inc., 1994). In a program context, the use of such risk factors as the basis for referral could either overwhelm the maternity care system, or, if only specific ones are used, focus attention on those women who contribute minimally to maternal deaths. In Guatemala, for example, 70 percent of the women would be considered at risk if age and parity were used as risk factors, while the system can only manage 20 percent (Schieber, 1993). In ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. Egypt, only 16.4 percent of deaths occurred among women aged less than 20 or more than 40 years, two common demographic factors. Although these women have a higher risk of death, the numbers of such women are low in comparison with women who die between 20-40 years of age simply because most pregnancies occur to women aged 20-40 (Ministry of Health, 1994). Educational background did produce some variation in the proportion of women with any symptom of obstetric complication in the Philippine survey. However, most of the variation could be explained by differences in cesarean section due to obstruction, the one complication that requires hospital treatment. This result has been interpreted to indicate that educated respondents had better access to medical services (National Statistics Office and Macro International, Inc., 1994). Any woman, regardless of age, parity, socioeconomic status, or education, can develop a complication at any stage of pregnancy, delivery, or the postpartum period. If a complication develops, it may be an emergency (e.g., hemorrhage) or may be taken seriously only when it reaches the stage of being an emergency (e.g., sepsis, eclampsia, obstructed labor). Anemia is targeted for detection (if screening is carried out) or prevention (if iron tablets are given to all pregnant women) during prenatal care. However, three decades of prenatal distribution of iron and folate tablets to pregnant women has had little impact on the levels of anemia. This outcome does not reflect lack of efficacy of iron supplementation: in supervised trials in both developed and developing countries, iron tablets are associated with improved maternal hematologic status (depending on the initial anemia status and dose and duration of supplementation) (Mahomed and Hytten, 1989; Sloan, Jordan, and Winikoff, 1992). The side effects that sometimes accompany iron consumption or women's dislike of the pills themselves (due to smell or taste) often have been blamed for the failure of programs to reduce anemia, although a recent literature review found that side effects accounted for only 10 percent of the noncompliance. Rather, in most cases, women did not take their pills because they never received them or received them in inadequate numbers (Galloway and McGuire, 1994). Not enough pills are purchased by health facilities or governments because of lack of funds or a perception that anemia is not a serious health problem. Yet even in areas where supplementation trials have taken place, overall prevalence of anemia often remains high. In India, for example, the prevalence of anemia decreased only from 88 percent to 56 percent in the highest iron dose group (240 mg) after a well-conducted trial by Sood ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. et al. (1975). The authors concluded that it is difficult to treat a severely iron deficient woman and provide for increased fetal needs through oral iron supplementation alone during the relatively short period of pregnancy. Thus, in developing countries, prolonged supplementation beginning before women become pregnant may be a more effective strategy to benefit the majority of the population (Sloan, Jordan, and Winikoff, 1992; Galloway and McGuire, 1994). Community-based distribution schemes along with counseling on why, how, and when to take pills and where to obtain refills could increase access and compliance. Long-term strategies to improve the overall iron status of the general population include increased production and consumption of iron-rich foods, increased family income, fortification of commonly consumed food with iron, and reduction of work for women. Food-based solutions for increasing iron consumption are not promising because most diets are plant-based and contain only small amounts of absorbable iron, except when fermented and germinated foods are added (which reduce the inhibitors of iron in the diet). Even when such additives are provided, food-based solutions seem to require increasing family income or the control of it by women. Fortification schemes have proved successful in developed countries and have virtually eliminated iron deficiency anemia in small children (Dallman, 1989, 1993). The key to successful fortification is finding a food that all vulnerable groups consume and regulating the private sector to ensure compliance with norms for fortification. These are not easy tasks. Even if an appropriate food is identified, women would still need to take supplements to meet their iron requirements during pregnancy. Reducing maternal workloads may decrease women's overall requirement for iron, and all programs addressing anemia should include counseling of family members so they can help reduce a pregnant woman's activities, particularly during her third trimester. Eclampsia and pre-eclampsia, the life-threatening complications of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, have proved difficult to predict or prevent. Although eclampsia is considered the terminal stage of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, a high proportion of cases occur in women in developed countries who did not have previous hypertension and proteinuria. This may be due to detection and management of patients with classic signs of pre-eclampsia, leaving a higher percentage of atypical eclampsia cases, or it may be that eclampsia can occur so rapidly that prior signs are not noted. At any rate, detection of the classic form of the disease is made difficult because its natural progression is not well understood, ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. and the relative importance of the degree and timing during pregnancy of the symptoms (hypertension, proteinuria, edema, or other biochemical abnormalities) is unclear (Rooney, 1992). Predicting pre-eclampsia is also elusive: only severe obesity and a history of pre-eclampsia have been found to be independently associated with severe pre-eclampsia (Stone et al., 1994). Primary prevention with low-dose aspirin or with calcium supplementation is being studied, although evidence is accumulating against the use of aspirin among low-risk women for prevention of pre-eclampsia (Villar and Bergsjo, 1996). Blood pressure measurements during pregnancy continue to be recommended, although the minimum number and timing of the measurements to detect cases of severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia is unknown (Rooney, 1992). Neither edema nor proteinuria detect pre-eclampsia as well as prenatal measurements of blood pressure (Golding, Shenton, and MacGillivray, 1988; Hall, Chng, and MacGillivray, 1980). However, urinalysis for proteinuria is recommended for all women on the first prenatal visit (along with blood pressure measurement) because of the severity of the disease if found in the early part to pregnancy. After the first visit, proteinuria should be detected during all visits only for nulliparous women or those with previous pre-eclampsia or hypertension (Villar and Bergsjo, 1996). Women with moderate or high hypertension with proteinuria require referral and treatment. The wide variation in case fatality rates for women from eclampsia or pre-eclampsia among countries suggests that differences in care can improve outcomes. Women with pre-eclampsia and eclampsia experience better outcomes when they have access to and use professional care (Rooney, 1992). Rest, antihypertensives, and anticonvulsants are presently considered possible treatments. Evidence is insufficient to determine the effect of bedrest, which in any case is often an unrealistic prescription. Antihypertensive drugs have been shown to prevent further increase in hypertension, but their effect on preventing pre-eclampsia is still uncertain (Rooney, 1992). For women who have already progressed to convulsions (eclampsia), a recent multicenter trial showed that the anticonvulsant drug of choice should be magnesium sulfate rather than diazepam or phenytoin, as it decreases the risk of recurrent convulsions (The Eclampsia Trial Collaborative Group, 1995). Approximately 30,000 maternal deaths yearly may be caused by tetanus (Fauveau et al., 1993). Where tetanus is a cause of maternal mortality, adequate protection for mothers may be provided during prenatal care by the tetanus toxoid immunization typically aimed at protecting newborns. ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. In the Philippines, tetanus toxoid injections have been given to all adolescent girls to increase the probability that they will be adequately protected the first time they give birth. Reproductive tract infections, including sexually transmitted diseases, should also be screened for and treated during prenatal care. As we note in , at a minimum, syphilis should be screened and treated during pregnancy, and newborns should be given prophylaxis for gonococcal and chlamydial eye infections (ophthalmia neonatorum). These eyedrops can be given by traditional birth attendants: they are simple, inexpensive interventions that are highly cost-effective in most parts of the developing world. Obstructed and prolonged labors are estimated to cause 40,000 maternal deaths each year, with many more survivors suffering obstetric fistulae while their newborns suffer death or brain damage from asphyxia. Prompt detection and management of obstructed and prolonged labor can have a beneficial effect on the outcome of pregnancy for both mothers and infants. Risk factors for this complication during pregnancy (e.g., height, foot size, or history of poor previous outcome) have not proven to be specific or sensitive enough (Fortney, 1995; Maine, 1991). But monitoring during labor allows for early intervention or referral with the consequent reduction in a number of sequelae of severe obstructed labor. A recent WHO multicenter trial of more than 35,000 women who delivered in eight hospitals in Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia found the partograph a beneficial tool for detecting labors that progress too slowly and led to guidelines for labor management (World Health Organization, 1994a). The partograph is a chart to record the progress of labor and other essential fetal and maternal observations. When the partograph shows an abnormal progress of labor, drugs may be used to improve the pattern of contractions for a normal delivery, or a cesarean section may be performed. Through comparison of patients before and after introduction of the partograph, this multicenter hospital study showed that the number of prolonged labors (> 18 hours) was halved, the rate of postpartum infection (sepsis) was cut by over one-half, and the number of still-births fell from 5 to 3 per 1,000 babies. Fewer drugs were also needed, and caesarean sections for women without complications were avoided, with no adverse impact on the condition of the fetuses. If labor is followed with the partograph by a medical professional in a home or health center, it is assumed that time would allow for referral to a medical center where prolonged or obstructed labor could be managed. However, there has been no trial on use of the partograph in the home or health center by medical staff. ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. Since the major causes of maternal mortality cannot be predicted or prevented well enough during pregnancy to allow reliance on primary prevention and screening, improvements in maternal death rates will require that women have access to facilities with trained providers and equipment that can carry out essential care of obstetric complications. Defined by WHO first in 1985 with refinements made in 1995 (World Health Organization, 1995), essential care of obstetric complications consists of: the ability to carry out surgery (i.e., caesarean section, treatment of sepsis, removal of an ectopic pregnancy), medical treatment (for shock, sepsis, anemia, and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy), manual procedures (e.g., removal of placenta, repair of episiotomies and perineal tears and vacuum extractions), monitoring of labor (including use of the partograph), management of problem pregnancies (severe anemia, diabetes, twins, malpresentation), manual vacuum aspiration for treatment of incomplete abortions, and provision of special care for neonates (e.g., resuscitation). Historical experience provides evidence for the effectiveness of this approach. It was not until the mid-1930s, with the introduction of medical technologies to treat obstetric complications, that maternal mortality began to decline in several European countries and in the United States. After antibiotics, blood transfusions, and improved surgical techniques in caesarean sections and safe abortions became routinely available in the industrialized world, maternal mortality all but disappeared (Loudon, 1991). Prior to that time, infant mortality had declined dramatically in the United States and Europe, but maternal mortality had remained constant. While the causes of infant death are extremely sensitive to environmental factors and respond quickly to improved sanitation and nutrition, the majority of obstetric complications that cause maternal deaths cannot be averted simply by improving women's overall health or nutritional status (Loudon, 1991). In Sweden, where mortality statistics have been kept since 1750, the maternal mortality ratio declined from 900 to 6 per 100,000 live births ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. between 1750 and 1980, with two-thirds of the decrease occurring in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This decline, not reported in other European countries, has been attributed to home-assisted births by trained midwives and the use of aseptic techniques. The decline in the maternal mortality ratio in Sweden in the twentieth century was attributable to the same factors as in the rest of Europe and United States (Hogberg and Wall, 1986; Hogberg, Wall, and Brostroin, 1986). Implementation of some elements of essential care of obstetric complications in a few developing countries have also resulted in substantial declines in maternal mortality (World Health Organization, 1995). Sri Lanka's maternal mortality ratio dropped dramatically: from 555 per 100,000 live births in 1950-1955 to 239 in the 1960s and to 95 in 1980. A nationwide extension of the health center system and expansion of midwifery skills are credited with this rapid decline. A major shift toward birth with trained personnel occurred over this 30-year period, with a major impact on the proportion of deaths attributed to sepsis. The use of medical services for delivery lags far behind use of prenatal care in most developing countries. Home birth, either alone or with someone from the community, remains a strong preference. WHO estimates that only 37 percent of births in developing countries take place in a health facility; more than 60 percent of births—or 55-60 million infants annually—take place with only the help of traditional birth attendants, family members, or no assistance (World Health Organization, 1993a). The reasons for the widespread acceptance of prenatal care throughout developing countries were captured nicely by Bolivian women who stated, ''because you're in a delicate condition,"" ""to see if the baby's okay"" (The Center for Health Research, Consultation and Education and MotherCare/John Snow, Inc., 1991). In 39 of 43 countries covered by DHS surveys between 1985 and 1994, coverage for prenatal care was found to be higher than for delivery care from a trained health provider (doctor, nurse, or nurse-midwife) (Macro International, Inc., 1994). In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, 15 of 22 countries surveyed had achieved over 75 percent prenatal care coverage (women's own definition of prenatal care was used), and only 2 had below 50 percent coverage (Macro International Inc., 1994). But only one country, Botswana, achieved over 75 percent of deliveries with professional health care providers. Between 50-75 percent of pregnant women in one-half of the other countries used ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. medical services for delivery, while in the other one-half of the countries less than 50 percent did so. Latin American and Caribbean countries have somewhat higher coverage rates than sub-Saharan African countries. In 3 of 11 Latin American countries (Trinidad and Tobago, the Dominican Republic, and Colombia), more than 75 percent of women both used prenatal care and gave birth with the assistance of a professional health care provider. In five countries, prenatal coverage rates ranged between 50-75 percent, and four of these had delivery assistance in the same range. Bolivia had prenatal care coverage in that range, but delivery assistance was slightly lower at 47 percent. In only one country, Guatemala, was coverage for both types of services less than 50 percent (Macro International, Inc., 1994). In the Asian countries surveyed, three-quarters of pregnant women used prenatal care, covering women in Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand; in Bangladesh and Pakistan, only one-quarter of women used prenatal care. Three of every four Sri Lankan women, one-half of Thai women, and two-thirds of Philippino women had a professional attending their deliveries. In the remaining three countries, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Indonesia, between one and three out of every ten women had a professional in attendance. Data on the use of postpartum services are relatively scarce, but the rates are typically lower than rates of institutional delivery. In the African countries for which data are available, coverage for postpartum care has for the most part not exceeded 40 percent, even in urban areas. Latin American rates are slightly higher than those for Africa, and Asian women seem the most likely to attend a postpartum clinic. However, data are sparse, and information is not available on the types of providers who are serving women in this period nor women's reasons for seeking such care (World Health Organization, 1993a). Even rates of coverage provide little information about the quality of care or the reasons for its use. What these coverage rates do show is that a substantial portion of women remain outside delivery and postpartum services for reasons that could range from taboos on mobility to preference to remain at home to the unavailability or inaccessibility of appropriate care. Women living in rural areas or having no education use all these services less than other women, while differences in age, parity, and birth interval are less consistent in determining coverage rates (Govindasamy et al., 1993). When facilities exist, service providers may lack the basic equipment and supplies, the person with the appropriate skills may be absent, or routine monitoring during pregnancy, labor, and delivery or in the puerperium may result in no follow-up of abnormal findings. ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. Since most women in developing countries experience labor and delivery outside the formal health care system, we discuss obstetric care under a four-step pathway to maternal survival, assuming that labor begins for a woman in her home (see also Thaddeus and Maine, 1994). From the point that an obstetric or newborn complication occurs, four steps are required to promote survival of the woman or the baby: recognizing a life-threatening complication by the woman, her family, traditional birth attendant, or others in attendance; deciding to seek care, typically by family members if the woman is in poor condition; reaching quality services, which often involves overcoming impediments such as distance, cost of or lack of transport, cost of the services, geographical or weather constraints, and perceived poor quality or attitude of the providers; and obtaining appropriate care for obstetric complications. Death of a woman, fetus, or newborn is likely to ensure if one of these steps is not taken. This same sequence is relevant when a woman suffering complications has made contact with a health care provider. If the provider diagnoses the problem, decides on the appropriate care, and refers to quality care on a timely basis or provides adequate care, death is more likely to be averted for the woman and her baby. The family side of this chain of events was followed in a retrospective study in the altiplano in a remote area of Bolivia (Bartlett, 1991). In only one-quarter of the cases resulting in maternal and neonatal deaths were the symptoms of a life-threatening condition recognized by the family in time, and in another one-quarter of cases the symptoms were not recognized at all. The most common response among the families who tried to do something about the problem was to administer home-made remedies to the sick mother or infant; fewer than one-third of families who took any action sought care from a source with at least some appropriate knowledge and resources (9% of the fatal cases). Pregnancy is generally considered a time of well-being. Evidence for The problems we classify under steps 3 and 4 (getting to care, poor quality of care) would also influence the family's decision whether or not to seek care. We discuss them sequentially, though, as a convenient way to classify needed interventions. ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. this view comes from focus groups with pregnant and recently delivered women in projects in rural areas of West Java, Indonesia, Bangladesh, and Nigeria; in rural and urban settings in Jamaica; and a periurban/urban area of Bolivia (see ). Labor and delivery, however, are anticipated with some trepidation: it is rightly considered, in the words of an Indonesian woman, the time when she is ""caught between life and death."" Jamaican women were even more expressive: ""Having the baby is life and death … is not cutting a slice of cake"" (Wedderburn and Moore, 1990:26). When the delivery is over, however, fears for the woman's life generally pass, and attention shifts to the newborn, for whom the first month of life is seen as challenging. If a complication for either the woman or newborn arises, it is often considered fated, with little that can be done. In Indonesia, most pregnant women are even reluctant to talk about possible complications because they believe talking may be prophetic. Hessler-Radelet (1993), in exploring these issues in West Java, determined that a complication may not be considered serious if it disappears after birth (e.g., as does swelling), does not cause pain (malposition), is treatable with medicine (e.g., fevers and headaches), is common in pregnancy (swelling), is common outside of pregnancy (e.g., fevers), does not restrict daily activities, or is inevitable (fate or the will of God). Bolivian women, for example, consider swelling beneficial, believing it to result from the accumulation of blood that is necessary for the birth to take place. Even fever following delivery is considered a normal part of the birthing process for most women. Bolivian women are the exception, however, greatly fearing complications in the postpartum period; several of the conditions they describe as dangerous include chills and fever. Although Bolivian women with fever are treated first at home, they may also go to the hospital (if referred) because of the perceived seriousness of this complication (The Center for Health Research, Consultation and Education and Mother-Care/John Snow, Inc., 1991). In Indonesia as well as in Bolivia, malposition is viewed by women and traditional birth attendants as the domain of the attendants. Following the seventh month, Indonesian women visit the attendants regularly for checks on the baby's position. Soothing massage is given to help pregnant women maintain the inner calm deemed necessary during pregnancy, labor, and delivery and to ""correct"" the baby's position (Ambaretnani, Hessler-Radelet, and Carlin, 1993). Referral may not take place until prolonged or obstructed labor is already under way. Bolivian women also seek attendants to correct the position of the baby through massage as well as , a gentle rocking of the woman in a blanket (The Center for Health Research, Consultation and Education, and MotherCare/John Snow, Inc., 1991). ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. Bleeding stands out as the one maternal complication that commands attention almost everywhere. During pregnancy, or in the intrapartum or postpartum periods, the extent of bleeding is watched apprehensively—""bad"" blood must leave the body, but ""good"" blood must remain. But there are exceptions even to this rule: Yoruba women of Nigeria stated that bleeding causes a pregnancy only to be interrupted, and the woman will take more than nine months to deliver (Public Opinion Polls, 1993). The Quechua and Aymara women of Bolivia believe they must watch what enters their bodies to control the necessary shedding of blood. A balance of hot and cold must be achieved after delivery, as ""dirty blood"" of childbirth must be lost, but not to the point of excessive bleeding. Cold air and being unclothed, or underclothed, as is often the case in a hospital delivery, are feared, as coldness suspends the expulsion of the ""dirty blood"" and can cause swelling of the body and a series of very dangerous puerperal illnesses according to women (The Center for Health Research, Consultation and Education and MotherCare/John Snow, Inc., 1991). Since traditional birth attendants oversee many deliveries, their recognition of symptoms of complications and knowledge of what to do about them can be critical for maternal and infant survival. In focus groups with attendants in Bolivia, Indonesia, and Nigeria, discussion of complications during any period of the reproductive process did not elicit much reaction. Their major role, as perceived by themselves, is the appropriate positioning of the baby. In West Java, for example, malpresentation was the major discussion topic. Malpresentations are managed by the attendants unless labor is prolonged, which one considered to be more than 8 hours. No attendant admitted a ""difficult labor."" Traditional birth attendants occasionally referred a patient to a health center or hospital, but most often the referral is declined, they stated, for reasons of expense, distance, and fear of being away from family and friends. In Indonesia and among the Fulani and Hausa of Nigeria, attendants said they will not even advise referral if they believe that the family will not comply. Bolivian attendants mentioned pain in the back, vagina, and belly and vaginal bleeding as pregnancy-related complications, and almost all of them attributed these symptoms to the poor position of the baby. Management includes massage of the abdomen or advice on rest; a few attendants do refer women to formal health services. Delivery complications they mentioned include a bad position of the baby, emergence of the umbilical cord, arm, or leg prior to the head, and the umbilical cord wrapped around the baby. These complications mean that women have not taken care of themselves or pushed too early, stated the attendants, and referral to a doctor is in order, although some mentioned they try to accelerate delivery by cutting the amniotic sack with a razor blade or massaging the abdomen. Most said a normal delivery is 4 to 14 hours, but ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. others said 1 to 3 days. If labor lasts longer than normal, the woman is given hot teas and massage. From these qualitative studies it can be concluded that neither women nor traditional birth attendants perceive obstetric complications as necessarily requiring medical assistance. Apart from bleeding, problems are generally explained by and thought to require other types of more spiritual interventions, described below. The attendants' role is primarily involved with the baby's position, and to her most other problems are explained by this central factor. Use of formal health care for delivery is rare not just because of perceptions about the services, lack of transport, distance, or funds. Home is strongly preferred as the place of birth for a variety of reasons. The decision to seek professional assistance for women suffering with complications is made even more complex by what is considered ""appropriate care."" Appropriateness depends on the perception of the interpreter as to the nature of the complication (physical versus spiritual) and of the seriousness of the condition. For bleeding, women most often seek medical care. But for other complications, such as obstructed labor—which is believed in one country to be caused by adultery during pregnancy—it is perceived to be more ""appropriate"" to consult a diviner and confess one's sins than to seek care from the formal health care system. According to the available qualitative studies, the demand for delivery services can be weak, even when other obstacles to access are absent. In Indonesia, the period of labor is seen to place women in a vulnerable position between life and death—death may come to her as life is entering this world. However, the forces that keep a woman in labor on the side of life are linked to the home and the inner calm that is found there, not to a health facility. Because Indonesian women do not want to think about negative events or plan ahead for such (which will disrupt their sense of inner calm), they instead plan for the best-chance scenario, hoping that a complication will not arise. Should a complication arise during delivery with a traditional birth attendant (who assists with 85% of deliveries in Indonesia), she may or may not be referred, depending on whether the attendant believes the woman will accept referral. For bleeding, however, most Indonesian women state they would seek help at the health center from a midwife or doctor (Ambaretnani, Hessler-Radelet, and Carlin, 1993). In Bolivia, the home provides privacy; no strangers to look, laugh, and touch the woman. As Bolivian women said (The Center for Health Research, Consultation and Education, 1991:23): ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. At home it's private, you don't pay anything. … They don't understand us well in the hospital; besides, my friends tell me that they touch everything—our genitals—and also there's a lot of health staff. Although the complications of delivery that can kill may be recognized by Bolivian women, they are not considered amenable to medical intervention (The Center for Health Research, Consultation and Education, 1991). Locally recognized causes of maternal death include , a disease caused by failing to bind the woman's head, and the rising up of the , an organ formed behind the navel during pregnancy that should be ""lowered"" during childbirth with the womb, baby, placenta, and blood. There is no organ equivalent in biomedical anatomy, but the fear of the rising is so great that women bind their abdomens to keep it down. To prevent these complications, Bolivian women not only bind their bellies, but also wrap their heads, drink teas and other home preparations, and massage bellies (both to apply heat and to assure the proper position of the baby). Few women believe that these problems could be prevented by going to prenatal care and to the hospital for delivery. The ""secret of pregnancy,"" the feeling of shame, and the uncertainty about the outcome are so strong among the Fulani and Hausa in Nigeria that no preparation is made concerning labor and delivery by women and their husbands. The home is the natural place for delivery, more familiar and less threatening than a medical facility, and does not expose one to shame. Little or no assistance is sought by these women during delivery, even in their home (Public Opinion Polls, 1993). The postpartum period, described most often by women as non-life-threatening, is generally filled with traditions and taboos. Many are harmless or beneficial, but some can interfere with the use of valuable postpartum services. Women in Indonesia are prohibited from leaving their home for 40 days, so they do not seek postpartum care from a formal health provider unless and until the situation becomes very grave (Ambaretnani, Hessler, and Carlin, 1993). Nigerian women go through a period of hot baths or massage with a hot napkin after delivery. Most Yoruba women claimed that this will rid the body of blood that has coagulated inside the woman during delivery. Failure to observe the hot bath period (7 to 40 days) is believed to meet with dire consequences—swelling and smelly vaginal discharge (Public Opinion Polls, 1993). Medical providers are not seen as beneficial at this time. There are many logistical and provider barriers to access for women trying to reach appropriate services once they and their families have determined to do so (Leslie and Gupta, 1989; Sundari, 1992; Kutzin, 1993; ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. Thaddeus and Maine, 1994). Lack of facilities with skilled personnel and equipment and supplies to support essential obstetric care, poor attitudes of providers, unavailability and cost of transportation, and the high costs of services are referred to repeatedly as the major obstacles to using services. Specific country-level efforts aimed at detailing these barriers to access essential obstetric services have only recently begun. The lack of services (including facilities, skilled personnel, drugs, and equipment) has been underscored in India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Guatemala, and Bolivia, as well as in the African countries of Nigeria, Ghana, and Sierra Leone. A UNICEF survey in three districts of India in 1993 found that two districts had a deficit of emergency obstetric care beds (those assigned for patients with emergency obstetric complications), assuming one bed is needed per 1,000 births. (Emergency obstetric care in their definition is a subset of what we have termed essential care for obstetric complications, consisting of caesarean sections, blood transfusions, as well as the availability of oxytocin, sedatives, and antibiotics.) In all three districts, the emergency obstetric beds were concentrated in district hospitals, resulting in a very high bed occupancy rate (110 percent in one of the districts). Between 4 and 10 percent of births were taking place in these first referral units, although 15 percent of births are expected to have serious complications (as described above). Actually, only 3.0 to 6.5 percent of complicated births were managed in these facilities. Using a list of 38 drugs as essential for effective management of common obstetric complications that can lead to maternal death (World Health Organization, 1995), the UNICEF survey found that not one of the 18 facilities observed had all the drugs. In fact, less than one-half of the essential drugs were available in most sites. Trained personnel to provide caesarean surgery was missing in 14 of the 18 facilities, and none of the first referral units had staff with neonatal resuscitation skills. Most sites did have anesthesia capability or a surgical specialist who might need only a short orientation; all but three of the sites needed staff training in blood transfusion services. Similar results were found in Indonesia and Bolivia. Each of three districts in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, had one or more government hospitals, but obstetricians were absent in two of the three districts. Although one midwife was available per 100-200 pregnant women, the midwives did not have the supplies or equipment (or the regulations to support them) to manage serious complications. Resuscitation equipment and skills were notably lacking, as was the skill to remove retained placenta, a common complication. Less than 5 percent of pregnant women delivered in the hospitals of the two districts for which there were data (Achadi et al., 1994). ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. In five districts in Bolivia, no obstetricians or anesthesiologists were found in two of the district hospitals. In a large urban district, no blood bank was available to support the district hospitals. There was a general shortage of client education materials. Privacy for provider-client counseling was lacking in the district hospitals (Seoane and Castrillo, 1995). In Nigeria, Ghana, and Sierra Leone, there were declines in deliveries in seven referral facilities from 1983 to 1989, paralleling increased costs to patients for drugs and services (especially in Ghana and Nigeria). These declines are believed to coincide with the introduction of fees in five of the seven sites. The effect of user fees on the number of complicated obstetric cases seen at a referral site is mixed, although the scant data suggest that the patients with complications are continuing to come in for management (Prevention of Maternal Mortality Network, 1995). In Indonesia, however, the obstacle of cost cannot be overestimated. According to one Indonesian woman: ""I have to live through today, before I can think about tomorrow. I can't put away money for a hospital birth, because if I do, we may not be able to eat tonight"" (quoted in Ambaretnani, Hessler-Radelet, and Carlin, 1993) Traditional care in Indonesia for prenatal and postpartum massages and child care plus delivery costs a total of U.S. $7.50 (1994), but a complicated delivery at a health center would cost nearly three times as much. If a hospital delivery with caesarean section is required, it could cost even 100 times the rate for traditional care (Achadi et al., 1994). Yet if a recognizable complication arises during delivery, most Indonesian families say that they will spare no expense to ensure that the woman and her baby are safe. But one husband expressed anger that his wife was referred to a hospital and then had a normal delivery there. He felt that they had spent a tremendous amount of money on something that they did not really need (Ambaretnani, Hessler-Radelet, and Carlin, 1993). It is not only the lack of supplies, logistics, or costs that create barriers. Provider attitudes remain a major hurdle. An example is seen from a focus group report from Nigeria. Doctors in the Yoruba community believe that good prenatal care could prevent many of the complications they see, but that ""pregnancy is considered to be a natural thing …"" and ""ignorance"" is pervasive. Hence, women obtain prenatal care only late in pregnancy. Nurses and midwives claim this late registration is due to the fact that attendance for prenatal care is very expensive, and women want to delay registering as long as possible (Public Opinion Polls, 1993). The few studies of the quality of maternity care point to major deficiencies ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. in the systems of care available and to a large gap between what facilities and life-saving skills are available and what is needed. Indicators of the quality of emergency care for obstetric complications at a facility include the time interval between admission to treatment, facility trends in case-fatality rates for all complications, the caesarean section rate, and trends in numbers of deaths (maternal and perinatal); the proportion of perinatal deaths contributed by stillbirths or early neonatal deaths and proportion contributed by full-term babies may also be useful. Such data have only recently begun to be collected in most places. Medical records are typically the source of such information, and they are notoriously lacking or incomplete. Medical or verbal autopsies of maternal deaths, in which causes of death and avoidable factors are determined by a medical team that reviews each death, have proven to be a very useful way to monitor deficiencies. Trends in the time from admission to treatment for emergency obstetric cases were observed in three referral sites in two African countries, Ghana and Nigeria. From a review of medical records, it was found that waiting time had increased from an average of 5 hours in 1983 to 15.5 hours in 1988 in Calabar (Ghana) for women who died of hemorrhage. In Zaria (Nigeria) the waiting increased from 3.5 to 6.9 hours between 1983 and 1988 (Prevention of Maternal Mortality Network, 1995). Although data on admission to treatment for most complications is often lacking, caesarean sections require an operating theater; typically, the dates and times of procedures are recorded. The average admission-to-treatment interval for emergency caesarean sections for six referral facilities in three districts of India was 1.5 to 5 hours. These long intervals were caused by the need to locate doctors who were on call and time for them to come to the facility. In another setting, a delay was caused by a patient's relatives having to purchase anesthetics outside the facility. Case fatalities in these sites ranged from 2.8 percent to 6.9 percent. Low case fatality rates were found in some cases because the most serious cases were referred to another facility or left the facility against medical advice. In Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, only 8 percent of patients had no wait upon arrival at the referral hospital; 45 percent waited up to 1 hour, and 47 percent waited more than 1 hour. Women in a study indicated that they would not accept referrals from traditional birth attendants to hospitals because of long waiting periods (O'Rourke, 1995). Most incriminating of the quality of care is a nationally representative study of 718 maternal deaths in Egypt in 1992 (Ministry of Health, 1994). Avoidable factors were assigned by a local advisory group of a panel of doctors for each governorate that met weekly to review each maternal death in that area; their decisions were reviewed by a central advisory group at the national level. The leading avoidable factor was poor management ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. and diagnosis by obstetric teams—47 percent. Patient factors, particularly delay in seeking (or compliance with) medical care, were blamed in 42 percent of deaths studied. Review of the maternal deaths revealed that there was no referral system in place in the Egyptian health care system, and that this gap affected when and where cases were referred. A disproportionately large number of the women had seen a private practitioner who delayed referral to a hospital. No protocols for managing complications were available, and most cases were managed by junior staff. Both traditional birth attendants ( who deliver nearly 60% of all births in Egypt) and general practitioners (who are sought only infrequently) played minor roles in the avoidable factors (12% each) (Ministry of Health, 1994). A similar investigation of 1,173 maternal deaths in China in 1990 also pointed to maternal services as the highest contributor to avoidable factors (48%), followed by individual and family delays in using health care and transport problems. All factors occurred more frequently at village and township level (68 percent) than at county or provincial level (32 percent) (World Health Organization, 1994b). In Guatemala, four departmental hospitals appear to have adequate numbers of beds and skilled staff available to manage serious complications, but they are highly underutilized for several reasons: traditional birthing positions (squatting, kneeling) are not permitted; no provision is made for respecting women's privacy; and language barriers make communication between providers and women and their families virtually impossible. Technical skills could also be questioned, as two cases of postsurgery tetanus had been reported in a previous year (Colgate-Goldman et al., 1994). Each of the steps in the pathway to survival may require one or more intervention(s), especially in rural settings where hom e birthing is not only preferred, but may be a necessity given the distance and adequacy of available health services infrastructure to respond to life-threatening complications. in urban and periurban sites, where women intend to deliver in a health facility, and do so to a large extent, interventions may aim at promoting more selective use of facilities. In both rural and urban areas, efforts to improve the quality of care are needed to complement community efforts to overcome the barriers to access. presents more details of the setting, implementation, and results of selected interventions at each of the four steps discussed below.

What seems like a simple and obvious lesson comes from projects in West Java, Indonesia (Alisjahbana et al., 1995), Bolivia (Howard-Grabman, Seoane, and Davenport, 1993; Bower and Perez, 1993), and Forteleza in Northeast Brazil (Janowitz et al., 1988; Bailey et al., 1991): focus on families because they are most involved in observing the progress of pregnancies and the ones who will benefit most by a good outcome of pregnancy for both the mother and newborn. Families and those who influence families, not just pregnant women, should be the focus of efforts aimed at recognition of obstetric and newborn complications. They should also be informed about where to take a woman when such complications are recognized. The woman herself often can tell if she has a problem, but she may not be in any condition to advise or influence others. Specific groups—husbands, mothers-in-law, sisters—as well as pregnant women and traditional birth attendants, may be targeted. Providing messages through different media and consistently over time may emphasize the seriousness of the message. Caution must be exercised in crafting locally appropriate messages, however. For example, pregnant women in Indonesia did not want pictures of possible complications near them as they believed they were sure then to have the complications (Hessler-Radelet, 1993). Traditional birth attendants provide labor, delivery, postpartum, and newborn care for the majority of women in many developing countries. Hence, it is tempting to train them in recognition of the danger signs of complications, but the results of such efforts have been mixed. Where women use formal medical services for birth if they have a complication, as appeared to be the norm for one-half the Guatemalan women in a study near the town of Quetzaltenango, training traditional attendants did not seem to improve the use of services for care of complicated cases (Schieber, 1993; Bailey, Szaszdi, and Schieber, 1994). Similarly, a randomized controlled trial in four cities of Latin America showed that an intensive intervention of home visits for health education had no impact on pregnancy outcomes—or even on use of postpartum services for women with complications—where women are already using services for labor and delivery and making a high number of prenatal visits (Villar et al., 1992). A home visit program with health education is probably not the answer to changing the behaviors of women who are already using services. However, where women do not use formal services even when they suffer a complication, training traditional attendants may increase the use of services when needed, as shown in a rural area of West Java (Alisjahbana et al., 1995). However, there can be a backlash, whereby ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. women no longer seek assistance because it is known that many women will be referred to an expensive setting. This problem must be addressed through a communications effort directed to women and their families. It is important that traditional birth attendants—and those who use their services—believe that making a referral adds to their credibility rather than detracts from it. Connecting attendants to medical facilities, and making them welcome at the facilities with the women, has also proved beneficial. Little is known about the decision making in families with regard to seeking care for complicated obstetric or neonatal problems. However, it appears that it is families that make the decisions. They may be influenced by traditional birth attendants, but as seen in the periurban Quetzaltenango project (Bailey, Szaszdin, and Schieber, 1994) and in the rural areas of Forteleza, Brazil (where a project to connect attendants and their clients with hospital back-up had been operating for 10 years) (Bailey et al., 1991; Janowitz et al., 1988), attendants were usually by-passed (as was the health center level staff) when a complication occurred. Hence, interventions should focus on families not only for recognition of problems, but also because they are the primary decision makers for determining whether and where they will seek care. While we know of only one effort to date to involve men directly in such efforts, in Inquisivi, Bolivia (Howard-Grabman, Seoane, and Davenport, 1994), men are the obvious target audience in many places because they control the cash reserves of the household or their permission must be sought for movement of women. A positive image of the referral site has proven effective in increasing use in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala (Bailey, Szaszdi, and Schieber, 1994). With training on protocols to manage complications and a sensitization of staff to cultural issues so that the hospital doors were opened to families and traditional birth attendants, more women began to use these services. There was no advertisement of these changes, but the news passed rapidly by word of mouth: a ''woman-friendly"" hospital appears to generate its own demand. The reverse of this was confirmed in the Danfa project in Ghana: women preferred traditional birth attendants because of their fear of anticipated treatment, described as painful and disrespectful, in the hands of medically trained staff (Eades et al., 1993). The barriers to reaching services are manifold even if the family is ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. positively disposed to using them. Distance to a referral site may be an obstacle, but three experiments aimed at ensuring transport, with taxi subsidies (Poedje et al., 1993), an ambulance (Alisjahbana et al., 1995), and a revolving fund for transport (Prevention of Maternal Mortality Network, 1995), did not alone increase the use of services. Transportation was not seen as the major obstacle in any of these three settings; rather, it was the costs or the perception of poor care at the end of the journey that proved more formidable. But improvements in transportation have been found useful in some settings. A low cost system of ambulances, relying on country boatmen to get women with complications to a hospital in rural Bangladesh, was an important part of a successful maternity care intervention there (Fauveau et al., 1991; Maine et al., 1996). Posting certified midwives in rural health centers to provide obstetric care in times of emergencies has appeared to be effective in reducing maternal mortality in rural Bangladesh, where use of formal health care for labor and delivery is exceedingly low (Fauveau et al., 1991). However, posting certified midwives in rural health centers on provincial or national level is costly and difficult, as is shown by efforts in Indonesia. Certain obstetric problems may be managed or stabilized at a peripheral level prior to referral (e.g., antibiotics for infections, sedatives for eclamptic patients), but severe cases may by-pass the midwife anyway and be taken directly to a hospital, and midwives may not see enough cases of severe complications each year to make the investment worthwhile. In Indonesia, for example, one midwife serves approximately 2,000 people. With a birth rate of 28 per 1,000 population and assuming a level of severe complications at 15 percent of all pregnancies, a village-based midwife would see 10-20 complicated cases per year—if complicated cases in her catchment area came to her. If a village-based midwife's tasks also included such efforts as improvements in women's health (e.g., family planning, iron/folate tablet distribution) and newborn and infant survival and health (breastfeeding promotion, cord care, eye care, warming of the newborn, as well as assistance for diarrhea and respiratory infections), however, it might make the investment worthwhile. Determining the most useful role for health centers and their staff in safe motherhood interventions is an important topic for further research. Maternity waiting homes are another intervention that has been tried to address the problem of distance. Such homes provide a site where women who live far away or who have had a prior poor birth outcome can stay within reach of the hospital before labor begins. Studies in Ethiopia and Zimbabwe have reported improvements in maternal mortality for women who use them (Poovan, Kifle, and Kwast, 1990) and in perinatal mortality (Chandramohan, Cutts, and Millard, 1995). But as Chandramohan, Cutts, and Millard (1995:266) state: ""For a maternity waiting ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. home to be effective, a high proportion of women must attend an prenatal clinic, there must be an effective screening and referral system in place, and hospital delivery must be acceptable to mothers."" Yet another alternative, birthing homes, where medically trained personnel can be called to assist in a difficult delivery at some distance from a hospital, have been tried in Forteleza, Brazil, as well as in Tanjungsari in West Java. The birthing homes with traditional birth attendants did not appear as attractive to women as either home or hospital delivery. Even 10 years after the initiation of a birthing home in Forteleza, only one in ten women sought to deliver there. Traditional birth attendants at the birthing homes in Fortaleza did prove to be effective in screening appropriate cases for referral to the main hospital, so an intermediate care facility like birthing homes may help promote a cost-effective system of referral (Bailey et al., 1991). From efforts in Guatemala, Nigeria, and Uganda, the lesson is simple and repeats lessons from other areas of public health: high-quality care generates demand. Use of delivery services increased where training of medical providers in advanced obstetric care was available (O'Rourke, 1995; Payne, Hooks, and Marshall, 1993; Mantz and Okong, 1994). This occurred although there had been no formal advertising of the improvements; word of mouth seemed to spread quickly, resulting in increased numbers of clients at a hospital within a matter of months. Training has been the major intervention to improve quality of care—training in life-saving skills (Marshall and Buffington, 1991) and interpersonal skills communication for midwives (Family Health Services et al., 1993). While highly appreciated among midwives, training of one cadre of workers is not enough to sustain the practices taught. Programs must also support the use of these skills with policies that allow the trainees to carry out their new skills, improved management and supervision, an information system that allows them to monitor their own progress, logistics and supplies, and training of those to whom the midwives will refer women (typically, specialist doctors). Protocols for the management of obstetric and neonatal complications have proved necessary (but not sufficient) for medical care providers to guide and coordinate their actions and know their limits and next steps. They have provided the standard against which to measure appropriateness of actions, especially if a maternal or perinatal audit is in place. Following institutionalization of neonatal care protocols in a referral hospital in Quetzaltenango, Guatemala, the hospital early neonatal mortality rate decreased from 33 to 26 per 1,000 women between 1989 and 1992, ""5: HEALTHY PREGNANCY AND CHILDBEARING."" National Research Council. 1997. Reproductive Health in Developing Countries: Expanding Dimensions, Building Solutions. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/5500. with a remarkable drop in avoidable factors assigned to the staff, emphasizing the pediatric staff's improved response to newborn problems (Schieber et al., 1995). Audits themselves can provide an internal mechanism to monitor and change provider practices. Where they have been implemented, as in India (Bhatt, 1989) and Egypt (Ministry of Health, 1994), they have proved a powerful tool, going beyond raising awareness of the problems. Factors determined to be avoidable can be used in monitoring on-going services. Using both audits and obstetric rounds for on-going services, and bringing together all levels of providers responsible for emergency obstetric clients might suffice to prevent future maternal deaths due to avoidable factors. Governments, in consultation with private-sector providers, need to establish a regional or national framework for maternity care, including the allocation of resources for each level of care. Many previous efforts to reduce maternal mortality in developing countries have foundered because they relied on attempts to train traditional birth attendants and screen high-risk pregnancies and refer women to expensive, distant, and ineffective sources of treatment. To save lives and reduce morbidity will require expenditures to upgrade facilities and train and supervise providers, as well as efforts to raise awareness at a community level of the signs of obstetric complications and how and where to seek appropriate care.

Obesity at conception linked to pregnancy complications These trusted information partners have more on this topic. Placenta accreta is a serious but rare pregnancy complication that causes heavy bleeding. If you have it, you will need special care at the birth. Pregnancy health problems & complications | Raising Children Network Many pregnancy health problems are mild, but always call your doctor if you’re worried about symptoms. A healthy lifestyle can help you avoid health problems. Most changes in your body are likely to be a normal part of pregnancy, but some signs may indicate things are not going well. Learn how to recognise them and know when you should seek help. Bleeding during pregnancy is relatively common, however you should always contact your midwife or doctor immediately if it happens to you. Placental abruption is when some or all of the placenta peels away from the uterus wall before birth. It can deprive the baby of oxygen and nutrients. After a stillbirth or neonatal death, your body may still experience the same changes it would after an uncomplicated birth. Find out what to expect and where to go for support. Placental abruption means the placenta has detached from the wall of the uterus, starving the baby of oxygen and nutrients. Placental insufficiency occurs when the placenta does not work properly and your baby doesn't get the oxygen and nutrients they need. Toxoplasmosis is a common infection that include mild flu-like symptoms, such as high temperature, sore throat and aching muscles. Some women will experience complications such as bleeding, itching high blood pressure or severe vomiting during pregnancy that will require treatment. Teenage Pregnancy Support (for Carers and Midwives) | Ausmed Teenage pregnancy, whether planned or not, can be a time of great vulnerability and it’s essential that accessible and relevant support networks are in place. Complications during pregnancy and birth result in the second largest cause of death in 15 - 19-year-old females, globally. This pathway provides guidance on the imaging of female patients presenting with suspected ectopic pregnancy. Perinatal depression and anxiety are perhaps more common than what we may realise. It is listed as the most common complication of pregnancy, with 18% of women having depression during pregnancy and 19% during their first year postpartum. In the last trimester of pregnancy, approximately 7% of women have such high levels of glucose in their blood their body can't produce enough insulin to absorb it all. Known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), it can be dangerous for both mother and baby if not managed appropriately (NHS 2018). Infertility is a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse (WHO 2017). There are, of course, many physical and emotional factors that can cause infertility. Somewhere in the world a woman dies every 4 minutes from postpartum haemorrhage (Durdas 2012). As well as being a terrifying experience for the mother it can also be one of the most serious and alarming emergencies that a Midwife has to manage.

If you think that your is anything but normal, it is very important for you to consult your doctor immediately, and take all necessary steps for preventing or treating the most common pregnancy complications. The most common pregnancy complications include , bleeding, , , placenta previa, and nausea, among others. Informing yourself of these risks, and taking proactive steps to prevent or treat them is essential for the health of both the mother and child. When a pregnancy ends on its own, prior to the 20-week mark, it can be physically damaging and emotionally devastating. If any blood, tissue or other bodily fluids pass out of the body in notable , it could be a sign that you have experienced a and have lost the baby. This process is irreversible once it has begun, and occurs in roughly 10-20% of pregnancies, sometimes before a woman even realizes that she is pregnant. While the gestational period for most babies is around 40 weeks, there are a few factors that can cause preterm labor, which is basically your body trying to give birth before it is. Some of the risk factors for this can be bearing multiple children at the same time, , being , or having a history of preterm labor in earlier pregnancies.

Many women experience , even if they are not at a high-risk of diabetes before pregnancy. This condition is typically temporary, and will often disappear within a few weeks of delivery. The cause of gestational diabetes is the body trying to of the growing baby, namely the body’s increased insulin sensitivity so additional glucose is available to nourish the baby. If this insulin resistance becomes a larger problem, gestational diabetes may arise, meaning that you will need to alter your pregnancy diet. An ectopic pregnancy is one in which the doesn’t implant on the wall of the uterus, but instead settles in a different part of the woman’s reproductive . This will often happen in the tube, which doesn’t have nearly enough room for a fetus to develop. When this incorrect implantation occurs, there is no way to reverse the effects, and the pregnancy must be treated (and consequently terminated) for the good of the mother’s health. Ectopic pregnancies occur in roughly 2% of pregnancies. In this medical condition, a woman’s uterus is positioned lower than in most pregnancies, which partially blocks the cervix. When you suffer from this condition, it is not necessarily dangerous for you or the baby, but it may be required that you have a cesarean section to , as the cervix is what must dilate before childbirth. Some of the common symptoms of placenta previa include bright red, painless vaginal bleeding throughout the pregnancy, particularly in the second and third trimesters. pregnancy comes in many forms, either as pre-existing hypertension or chronic hypertension, which was present before the pregnancy began, or gestational hypertension, which may occur at any point during the pregnancy, often in the later trimesters. However, this condition must be taken seriously, as it can lead to preeclampsia and loss of protein through urine, which can have long-term effects and may require immediate treatment. isn’t uncommon, particularly light bleeding or spotting in the first few weeks following when the egg attaches itself to the wall of the uterus. This implantation often leads to light bleeding, which is a concern for many women. bleeding at other points in pregnancy, particularly in the second and third trimester, may be an indication of many other issues, so you should discuss any instances of bleeding with your doctor as soon as possible. is a very common symptom of pregnancy and affects the majority of women at some point in their pregnancy.

This disease can affect women who have Rh-negative blood and conceive a child with a man who has Rh-positive blood. The mother’s body won’t recognize the blood platelets and will develop in response. Fortunately, most babies are born before these antibodies are produced in large numbers, but this disease can affect subsequent pregnancies, as the antibodies may cross into the fetus, causing more pregnancy complications. There are quite a few types of pain you will experience during pregnancy, from cramping due to the growth of the baby to back pain that may be caused nerves. While a certain amount of pain and discomfort during pregnancy is normal, it is you who knows your body better than anyone. If a pain seems acute and sudden and doesn’t go away with rest, icing or changing position, it may be time to speak with your doctor about what it could mean for your pregnancy. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00325481.1953.11708135 http://science.sciencemag.org/content/308/5728/1592 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1994.tb21771.x/full http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/25/10/1862.short https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1954586/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002937897704630 John Staughton is a traveling writer, editor, publisher and photographer with English and Integrative Biology degrees from the University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana (USA).
